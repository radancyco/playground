WEBVTT

00:07.140 --> 00:07.874
What's going on?

00:07.874 --> 00:11.444
And welcome back to season
four of the Life at Disney Podcast.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.080
Disney College Program,
mini series. I'm Josiah.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.382
And I'm Holly.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.016
Okay, so, Holly.

00:16.016 --> 00:20.320
So neither one of us have been able to do
a Disney college program, unfortunately.

00:20.320 --> 00:20.987
Right.

00:20.987 --> 00:23.790
But if you could, what would your role be?

00:23.790 --> 00:24.958
Easy money.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.760
I would on be a character attendant.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.996
I feel like walking around the park
with your favorite characters.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.331
It's a vibe. I love it.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.533
I want that about you.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.968
I'm thinking photo ops.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.738
I feel like getting behind the camera,
seeing everybody's cool moments.

00:38.805 --> 00:39.406
That would be fun.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.509
Yes, I can definitely see that for you
for sure.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.378
And like what you're wearing right
now, the bright green. Yeah.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.414
Photo passes. You see it?

00:47.414 --> 00:48.248
I see the vision.

00:48.248 --> 00:51.684
Yeah, Well, like you said,
we didn't get to do a college program,

00:51.684 --> 00:54.687
but our guests today
are currently on their program,

00:54.754 --> 00:57.624
and they're here to talk to us
about their experience.

00:57.624 --> 00:58.425
Let's get into it.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.426
Let's do it.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.493
welcome to the show.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.528
Gaby and Avi.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.531
We are so happy to have you here. Hi.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.732
So happy to be here.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.301
I feel like we're kind of sitting down
with, like,

01:08.301 --> 01:10.804
almost like a girl, like pop group.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.907
Gaby. Avi, I like it. I like the vibes.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.409
Yeah, I work for a good team, though.
It's perfect.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.746
So at some point, we have to figure out,
like, what your debut album is going

01:19.746 --> 01:21.147
to be called, you know?

01:21.147 --> 01:23.349
that would be capable of to run
and everything.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.251
we get producer credit on it.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.154
Yeah. Okay. Right, Right.

01:28.154 --> 01:31.391
Anyway, for everyone listening,
can you introduce yourselves?

01:31.391 --> 01:34.260
Your first name, your role
and something fun.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.796
Holly What should they add? favorite
Disney character.

01:36.796 --> 01:37.697
Classic.

01:37.697 --> 01:38.431
I'm Gabby.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.367
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I am in merchandizing.

01:41.367 --> 01:44.804
I'm in Epcot, in America, Morocco
and International Gateway.

01:44.904 --> 01:50.143
And then my favorite character
is going to be Princess Tiana.

01:50.243 --> 01:50.777
Excellent.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.378
My name is Abby.

01:52.378 --> 01:54.214
I am from Northern Kentucky.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.117
I am a resort custodian at Ulster Movies.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.787
And I think my favorite Disney character
probably has to be Elsa.

02:00.854 --> 02:01.855
Who do you like?

02:01.855 --> 02:04.090
Elsa in Frozen one or Frozen two?

02:04.090 --> 02:05.625
Do you have a preference?

02:05.625 --> 02:07.060
Frozen two. Frozen two.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.095
Which is like, fully like in her powers.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.097
Like Queen of the Universe.

02:11.097 --> 02:14.467
Yes. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. If okay?

02:14.467 --> 02:15.635
So tell us a little bit.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.371
How did you hear about the Disney College
program?

02:18.371 --> 02:23.309
Well, actually, one of my classmates
did the Disney College program first,

02:23.543 --> 02:28.014
and when he came back, I
he was so excited about it and I was like,

02:28.114 --> 02:31.017
let me, you know,
ask him about and stuff like that.

02:31.017 --> 02:33.419
So and he was like, girl,
you have to do it.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.554
Like, it's an experience.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.589
You'll never get anything else like that.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.558
Like you have to do it. And I was like,
okay.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.160
And I was convinced from then and then,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.828
you know,
you always had to talk to your mom.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.263
So I was on the phone with my mom

02:43.263 --> 02:45.098
and it was like, well,
he said it was a good experience

02:45.098 --> 02:47.367
and I think this will be fun
after I graduate.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.368
So what do you think?

02:48.368 --> 02:50.803
And she was like Disney. Yes.

02:50.803 --> 02:54.574
So I went ahead and, you know, got on my
computer and click, click, click there.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.042
I would

02:56.109 --> 02:56.843
love to see it and

02:56.843 --> 02:59.846
shout out to your classmate
who got you here. Yes.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.347
Yeah, that's a real one. Yeah.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.549
So that's your mom, too?

03:02.549 --> 03:04.584
Yeah. Yes. Yes. The first.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.586
Yeah. Mom's.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.121
I'm in a sorority at my school.

03:08.121 --> 03:13.626
And when I first joined, I found out that
everyone in my sorority family had done

03:13.626 --> 03:17.997
the Disney College program before,
and they were huge advocates of it.

03:18.131 --> 03:22.835
This was nothing I had ever heard of,
so it was an entirely new thing.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.005
It was a program that changed their lives

03:26.239 --> 03:29.676
and that had a big impact
on my decision to apply.

03:29.776 --> 03:34.314
I was just like, Well, they like it so
much, then I might as well give it a shot.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.150
I can take a little bit. Yeah, yeah.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.119
And it's always helpful
to have people who have that, you know,

03:40.119 --> 03:42.655
who've had that experience too,
because it's like, All right, I trust you.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.624
You know,
you're not going to get me wrong.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.024
yeah.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.928
So you, you, you apply
and then you obviously get something back

03:48.928 --> 03:50.430
that says you're moving on
to the next step.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.932
So what was the interview process like?

03:52.932 --> 03:56.202
I think for me it was a little scary

03:56.302 --> 03:59.772
Just because I'm in college,
I have, you know, classes going on

03:59.772 --> 04:02.842
and I'm also at a sorority
and I was on the executive board.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.078
So I'm like doing,
you know, a whole bunch of stuff.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.415
So like when I first got that email, like,
you're moving on to the next process

04:09.415 --> 04:10.450
and you're going to interview.

04:10.450 --> 04:14.554
When I tell you I was on the YouTube like,
Disney calls program

04:14.554 --> 04:17.557
interview, what the questions like, like
I like to be overprepared.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.961
So in between, like my meetings
and my classes as I was preparing,

04:21.995 --> 04:25.832
trying to figure out, okay, you know,
what's the best way to like,

04:25.832 --> 04:28.301
show my enthusiasm,
you know, through a phone

04:28.301 --> 04:29.869
because you're not face to face,
you know, Yeah,

04:29.869 --> 04:33.740
I had sort of a similar experience,
actually, because the interview came

04:33.740 --> 04:35.275
right at the end of the semester,

04:35.275 --> 04:38.978
which is a very busy time,
have a lot of work piling up.

04:39.045 --> 04:42.582
So it was just one of those other things
that I was trying to prepare for.

04:42.649 --> 04:46.953
Did a lot of research on YouTube, a
and then I was also nervous for

04:47.053 --> 04:50.657
the fact that it was over the phone
and not like a Zoom call or in person

04:50.657 --> 04:54.594
because I consider myself
someone who is very expressive

04:54.794 --> 04:59.132
and I think that is a large appeal of me
as an applicant.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.369
So I was trying to figure out a way
that I could express how excited I was

05:03.369 --> 05:06.873
and how badly I wanted this
and that I was motivated to do the work.

05:07.106 --> 05:07.373
yeah.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.942
So it seems like a lot of outside
research.

05:09.942 --> 05:15.081
Let's go into like the actual interview
and like what your experience was with

05:15.081 --> 05:19.285
that tips that you would give to someone
when they're doing their phone interview.

05:19.385 --> 05:23.256
I think finding a quiet place
somewhere that you're like, comfortable.

05:23.256 --> 05:27.393
I know a lot of people are in college
and they're like, like little spaces

05:27.393 --> 05:30.863
that you can go to to like,
do community work and stuff like that.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.231
That's where I did mine.

05:32.231 --> 05:36.536
I did it in my library
because that's my safe space.

05:36.636 --> 05:41.574
So I did it a quiet space,
and I always like to prepare

05:41.607 --> 05:45.411
like 30 to an hour like earlier
than when my interview,

05:45.411 --> 05:48.381
like I kind of knew like what day
and what kind of what time.

05:48.381 --> 05:52.652
So I got there an hour early
and I just, you know, count myself,

05:52.685 --> 05:55.988
listen to some some music
chilled for a little bit, you know,

05:55.988 --> 06:00.126
talk to a really good friend
and then, you know, took a minute to

06:00.126 --> 06:04.263
have you heard of the
It's called a power pose.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.499
Yeah. So, yeah, yeah.

06:06.499 --> 06:13.206
I literally went to the library bathroom
and I was proposing that was Kermit.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.975
He was blown away by your power,
you know.

06:15.975 --> 06:16.776
There you go.

06:16.776 --> 06:20.213
But, yeah, I did my little power pose,
and I told myself, You're confident

06:20.213 --> 06:21.381
you got this.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.316
You have nothing to be concerned about.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.517
You're amazing.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.153
Let's do it. And then I sat back down
and I did my interview.

06:27.153 --> 06:30.156
Yeah, And it works. Yeah.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.624
Okay. Ivy, what about you?

06:31.624 --> 06:35.094
Okay, I think my biggest tip
would be to treat it

06:35.094 --> 06:39.832
like it's an actual interview,
Another thing is, in most interviews,

06:39.832 --> 06:43.703
they're always going to ask you
to tell, like, Tell us about yourself.

06:43.803 --> 06:48.441
So if you can come prepared with that,
that'll get you off to a great start.

06:48.474 --> 06:52.412
Make you feel more confident,
Be ready to lay out

06:52.412 --> 06:54.280
all of your skills and qualities.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.748
They want to talk to you.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.716
Don't be nervous.

06:56.716 --> 07:00.820
All the interviewers here were super
duper nice, which is a big relief,

07:01.020 --> 07:04.357
but just have confident come prepared,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.859
do some research
and I think you'll be perfect.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.227
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

07:08.227 --> 07:12.765
If you were to put together a playlist
because I think Gabby, you mentioned

07:12.765 --> 07:13.666
listening to music.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.468
What genre of music

07:15.468 --> 07:19.071
for both of you gets you like the most
and like the most prepared.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.241
so probably be my gym playlist.

07:22.241 --> 07:28.347
And that's more of like it's
alternative R&B and it can be like a

07:28.347 --> 07:32.985
it is a slow jam, which I'm like,
why are you like, you know, you

07:33.052 --> 07:35.288
need to slow down, but I can do not.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.323
That just gets me like, get ready, go.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.158
Like,

07:39.158 --> 07:40.626
yeah, it's a good one.

07:40.626 --> 07:41.761
Driving to a slow jam.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.830
So that's the name of your debut album?

07:43.830 --> 07:45.064
Yeah, we found it.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.800
I'm bringing it to you.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.101
Disney songs, of course.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.170
Some upbeat, some cheery.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.371
One of those, like, hero songs.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.240
Frozen is definitely on there.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.074
How about Coco?

07:55.074 --> 07:55.842
Coco?

07:55.842 --> 07:57.743
Coco is definitely no.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.412
People might make you cry, though.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.880
I feel like I remember me.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.350
I'm just going to be like I was

08:04.417 --> 08:07.720
excited to be on the Disney
cause the Poco logo.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.322
Okay. Yes, Yes, right.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.923
That's my job right there.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.091
Yeah. Okay.

08:12.091 --> 08:16.262
So something that we don't often talk
about is like that time frame

08:16.362 --> 08:19.866
after you do your interview
and before you get anything back.

08:20.099 --> 08:23.636
Well, you're kind of just like waiting
and your expectations are high.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.404
You're kind of anxious,
you're overthinking.

08:25.404 --> 08:29.275
How do you kind of like what advice
do you have for that specific point before

08:29.275 --> 08:32.011
you get anything back?

08:32.111 --> 08:35.047
I would
probably say just don't think about it.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.282
I don't.

08:36.282 --> 08:41.187
Again, I'm also a overthinker,
so I literally had to put my phone down.

08:41.354 --> 08:47.293
try to remain as calm as you can trust
that everything happens for a reason.

08:47.393 --> 08:50.863
I think the beauty of Disney as a company
is that it'll be around

08:50.863 --> 08:52.398
for a very long time.

08:52.398 --> 08:56.502
So if this isn't the right time for you,
don't let that be

08:56.569 --> 08:58.971
the most crushing, devastating feeling.

08:58.971 --> 09:02.508
But also have confidence
in your interview.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.710
Know that you're a good applicant.

09:04.710 --> 09:08.214
Don't trust your approach
looking like you think it'll be okay.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.750
Just keep your mind off of it.
Get excited for Disney.

09:10.750 --> 09:15.454
Definitely don't spend all night
watching TikTok videos about the Disney.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.422
That doesn't make you any less.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.224
That is good.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.526
Everything will work out
as it should. Yes.

09:20.526 --> 09:25.765
And in your case, obviously it did
So what was that moment like?

09:25.765 --> 09:26.332
We'll start with you.

09:26.332 --> 09:30.436
Have you like what was it like
to finally get the notification you're in?

09:30.536 --> 09:33.072
my gosh. I was so excited.

09:33.072 --> 09:37.643
It was such an amazing moment because
it was something that I wanted so bad.

09:37.877 --> 09:41.881
I think I'd spent that entire semester
picturing myself here at Disney.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.416
I would walk on my campus.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.183
Mark So I was like,

09:44.183 --> 09:47.186
I got to got to get my steps up,
so I'm able to walk around the parks.

09:47.253 --> 09:52.091
But it was just it was so rewarding
and I had such an incredible

09:52.091 --> 09:55.561
feeling of excitement towards my future
and what this program

09:55.561 --> 09:59.131
was going to do for me
professionally and just emotionally.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.132
It was awesome.

10:00.132 --> 10:03.336
I would say. I was like very excited.

10:03.336 --> 10:08.307
I was actually in a sorority meeting
and I got the email

10:08.307 --> 10:14.547
and I couldn't really, like,
you know, do anything other than like,

10:14.647 --> 10:15.648
you know what I mean?

10:15.648 --> 10:20.353
But after I got out of the meeting,
I was jumping for joy because it

10:20.419 --> 10:25.391
this program was also
my internship class for my degree.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.160
So that was even more exciting
that it was Disney.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.463
It wasn't
something like, you know, boring.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.865
But, but I was just so excited.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.133
I was like, this is awesome.

10:34.133 --> 10:38.337
And I've only been to Disney
once before this.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.241
So I was like, Okay, well, I have
I don't know much.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.444
So this is an opportunity
for me to explore the parks,

10:45.444 --> 10:49.181
like truly
get into the, into the lure of Disney.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.816
So yeah, I was super excited.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.884
Yeah, absolutely.

10:51.884 --> 10:55.688
And I feel like I want to touch on that,
like not necessarily knowing a lot

10:55.688 --> 10:56.889
about Disney going into that.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.625
Was that something
that was maybe intimidating?

10:59.625 --> 11:02.862
Do you have advice for anyone who
maybe isn't as familiar with the parks?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.196
you learn as you go.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.500
And I think a lot of people don't have
some people have like

11:07.500 --> 11:10.736
a lot of Disney lot knowledge,
but other people don't.

11:10.736 --> 11:11.637
And that was me.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.040
And you get to learn
from those people as well.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.841
So it's just all a learning experience.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.009
Yeah, totally.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.911
Abby Had you been to the parks before?

11:18.911 --> 11:21.514
Were you familiar with Disney
or were you kind of in the same boat?

11:21.514 --> 11:26.252
I had been to the parks
a few summers with my family,

11:26.318 --> 11:28.988
but I think I was definitely lacking

11:28.988 --> 11:33.192
in the Disney movie knowledge
and the Disney TV show knowledge.

11:33.292 --> 11:36.796
So I was a little nervous
that, everyone here is going to

11:37.063 --> 11:38.464
be so much more advanced for me.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.332
Like we're not going to be able
to bond over everything.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.501
I can talk about
how much I love rollercoasters,

11:42.501 --> 11:44.036
but are they going to want to hear that?

11:44.036 --> 11:47.106
And the answer is yes, you. my gosh.

11:47.106 --> 11:51.444
You will find someone
who has so many similar interests as you.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.045
So many different interests.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.681
I mean, everyone here
has one thing in common, and that is

11:55.681 --> 11:58.684
Disney means something to them in some way

11:58.684 --> 12:02.388
and to talk to people,
learn about what that is, tell them

12:02.388 --> 12:05.691
about what it means for
you has been really awesome.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.426
Okay, so let's see.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.529
We've done the application, we've done
the phone interview,

12:10.663 --> 12:13.132
we've gotten the notification
that we are in.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.267
We are part of the Disney College program.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.602
What happens after that?

12:16.602 --> 12:20.473
I think one big question here a lot
is around roles and role preferences.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.941
How does that work?

12:21.941 --> 12:27.413
So during your interview
they ask what are your preferred

12:27.513 --> 12:28.514
roles?

12:28.514 --> 12:32.017
And I've
worked retail since I was like 15,

12:32.017 --> 12:35.020
16 and I was like, Please put me in Birch.

12:35.221 --> 12:38.557
I beg to be a emergency vet.

12:38.557 --> 12:41.560
So luckily
I did get that merchandise role.

12:41.794 --> 12:46.499
And so then from there they like
kind of puts you in a specific park.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.400
So or resort.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.302
So I really want to work in the parks.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.038
Like I said, I've never you know,
I haven't only been there once.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.775
I was like, yeah,
let me in the parks, please.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.443
So luckily I got Epcot.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.546
And so from there I just did
a little bit of research about like

13:00.546 --> 13:03.582
what building
in my going to be in and stuff like that.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.552
It was just a quick Google search
just to, you know,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.454
get my little my grounds to,

13:08.454 --> 13:11.457
you know, show my parents like,
hey, this is exactly where I'll be working

13:11.457 --> 13:12.158
and stuff like that.

13:12.158 --> 13:16.295
I think it's important
to note that during the interview process

13:16.395 --> 13:20.299
they had a section where you can put roles
you're not really comfortable with.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.602
So like for me,
I put Don't make me a lifeguard

13:23.602 --> 13:26.405
because I will not be good
at saving anyone's life.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.740
the swimming in poor sleep.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.210
If you're not a strong swimmer, just

13:31.277 --> 13:34.280
let let's just go do another.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.815
But aside from that, you're able

13:35.815 --> 13:39.819
to kind of rank in order
which ones you want to do the most.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.689
And in your interview,
you have an opportunity to talk about it.

13:43.789 --> 13:47.726
And I think sometimes
the selection process is kind of random,

13:47.726 --> 13:49.461
but they also want to make sure you're

13:49.461 --> 13:53.165
as happy and successful
as possible in this program.

13:53.232 --> 13:58.771
And it's kind of nerve wracking not
knowing for sure what you're going to get.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.106
But it's it doesn't make or break
the program.

14:01.106 --> 14:02.908
The program is not dependent
upon your role.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.010
It is just one aspect of it.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.547
Do you have any other advice for people
who because it's not guaranteed, Right.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.715
Do you have any advice for people

14:09.715 --> 14:12.017
who may not get that role
that they're looking for

14:12.017 --> 14:14.553
and just how to make
the most of that moment?

14:14.553 --> 14:18.057
I would say honestly,
like every role is fun

14:18.057 --> 14:21.594
and you may not like, that
that's not the role that I want it a lot.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.464
But it's really when you either
at the parks or the resort,

14:25.698 --> 14:30.703
you always get these guest interactions
wherever you are in your role.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.538
And I feel like that's like the best

14:32.538 --> 14:36.342
part of it is you get to communicate
with other people and learn

14:36.475 --> 14:38.510
like their experiences
and stuff like that.

14:38.510 --> 14:42.648
And I will say, like your other cast
members really make this experience

14:42.648 --> 14:47.820
what it is, and especially like
our coordinators in our leaders,

14:47.920 --> 14:52.691
wherever you are,
they will make sure that your role is

14:52.758 --> 14:56.028
you'll have the best time
there during your program.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.496
Yeah,

14:57.563 --> 15:00.099
be open minded.

15:00.099 --> 15:03.502
This is a challenging experience,

15:03.736 --> 15:07.306
especially if you have never lived away
from home before

15:07.539 --> 15:10.342
or you don't have a ton of work
experience.

15:10.342 --> 15:14.914
But as long as you go in with an open mind
that's what's going to set you

15:14.914 --> 15:18.817
up for success Okay, so let's dive
into your roles a little bit.

15:18.817 --> 15:21.253
We have merchandizing, we have custodial.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.890
What is a day in the life
in those roles look like?

15:24.990 --> 15:30.329
So usually I'm working
like the closing shifts,

15:30.396 --> 15:33.232
so it's usually hectic.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.701
There's a lot of guests coming in
and out of the store.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.369
I'm also at Mobility

15:37.369 --> 15:41.106
that is helping with strollers
and wheelchairs as well as CVS.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.875
So there's just a lot going.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.612
So when you come in, wherever you're
supposed to be going, go straight there.

15:46.745 --> 15:49.281
Hello, my name is Gary.
How can I help you today?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.283
Are you all looking
for a specific character?

15:51.283 --> 15:54.353
And most of time they usually are here
so that you just, you know,

15:54.353 --> 15:57.356
point them, direct them
to where they're supposed to go.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.959
if you have mobility, you're
just going to help out with wheelchairs.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.994
Make sure you grab strollers
and stuff like that.

16:01.994 --> 16:06.832
And then my favorite part, especially
about mobility, is riding the nametags.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.535
You ask them like,
what name would you like on it?

16:09.535 --> 16:13.572
And you write it all nice and pretty, add
some mickeys in there and I kid you not.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.074
It makes their day.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.508
They're like, This is so nice.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.277
And I'm like, No problem.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.012
That's the Milky Way.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.448
And then, you know,
you let them on their way and, you know,

16:22.448 --> 16:26.785
and it's a great experience
to just be around people.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.522
24 seven during our like,
you know, our busy shifts.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.225
And then at night
we get to see the fireworks.

16:33.225 --> 16:36.228
And so it's really nice to enjoy that.

16:36.228 --> 16:39.598
And at the end of the day, we,
you know, restock the store

16:39.598 --> 16:42.835
and make sure it looks nice
for the next guest the next day.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.403
Yeah,

16:44.470 --> 16:45.437
I think there are

16:45.437 --> 16:49.441
two distinct sides to being in custodial,

16:49.508 --> 16:53.045
and I can only speak for what it means
in the resort, not necessarily the parks.

16:53.045 --> 16:57.883
I know it's kind of different,
but the first being you're responsible

16:57.883 --> 17:01.420
for keeping the area
looking nice and clean.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.491
Sometimes we're called the show keepers
because Disney is all about the show

17:05.691 --> 17:08.861
and putting on just a performance
for all of the guests.

17:09.061 --> 17:13.365
And so as the show keepers, we make sure
the stage looks nice and clean

17:13.532 --> 17:17.436
and there's no spills or something
that I guess is going to slip

17:17.436 --> 17:19.371
on when you walk
by making sure everyone's safe.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.606
That's one side of it.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.842
There's a whole bunch of different things
you can do cleaning wise,

17:23.842 --> 17:26.945
but the other side and the side
that it's most important to me

17:27.179 --> 17:31.617
is this is a really big role
for guest interaction

17:31.683 --> 17:35.487
because the resorts have a lot of freedom

17:35.554 --> 17:37.222
and they have something that the parks
don't.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.525
And it's the fact that

17:39.591 --> 17:42.961
guests are staying
there and you have the chance to see them

17:42.961 --> 17:48.700
multiple times, which is a really big Jim,
because you are now presented

17:48.700 --> 17:52.571
with this opportunity to form a more
in-depth relationship with the guest,

17:52.805 --> 17:56.341
which just goes towards
enhancing their overall experience.

17:56.442 --> 18:00.212
And that's that's my favorite part
of this whole program, is

18:00.279 --> 18:03.048
being able to interact with everyone.

18:03.048 --> 18:07.386
One thing we're always told is
if someone asks you for directions,

18:07.386 --> 18:09.455
you never point.
You're like, it's over there.

18:09.455 --> 18:14.359
You can find it as a custodian.

18:14.426 --> 18:14.860
Laughing.

18:14.860 --> 18:19.131
Their signs, I think, Enjoy.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.834
But yeah, you're supposed to do that.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.869
And as a custodian,

18:23.869 --> 18:27.806
we're supposed to be the people
who can lead them there and it's awesome.

18:27.806 --> 18:31.043
I will literally walk and go off
for 20 minutes or so.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.713
Just talking with people. It's

18:34.780 --> 18:35.314
awesome.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.015
It's my favorite part.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.285
I love what you said about
sometimes just going off with a guest,

18:40.285 --> 18:44.189
and that really is so normal
and almost expected.

18:44.189 --> 18:47.025
And, like, one of the best
parts of working at Disney is like,

18:47.025 --> 18:50.863
you really get to prioritize
those guest interactions and like creating

18:51.096 --> 18:52.798
magical moments for them.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.634
So my question is, have either of you
been able

18:55.634 --> 18:58.770
to create a magical moment
for your guest? Yes.

18:58.837 --> 19:03.709
So there was this couple who came into
this store and I kid you not.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.577
They were looking around and I'm like,

19:05.577 --> 19:07.746
okay,
they're they're searching for something.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.682
So I came up and I was like, Hi,
I'm Gabby.

19:10.682 --> 19:11.817
How can I help you?

19:11.817 --> 19:14.253
Is there a certain, like, character
you're looking for?

19:14.253 --> 19:17.756
She was like, Yes,
So I'm looking for the orange bird ears.

19:17.756 --> 19:20.726
Is there any way do you have them?

19:20.726 --> 19:22.261
Like, where can I find them?

19:22.261 --> 19:25.864
And unfortunately,
because that was the mascot for Flower

19:25.898 --> 19:27.466
and Garden Festival and Flower

19:27.466 --> 19:31.436
and Garden Festival had ended the day
before they had come.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.406
So both of the merchandise
with the orange bird on

19:34.406 --> 19:38.877
it had already, you know, either been sold
or has gone to the back.

19:38.944 --> 19:39.878
So I was like, you know, it

19:39.878 --> 19:45.150
let me check the back because I might have
seen one last pair of orange bird ears.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.752
So she was like, my gosh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.020
I was like, Yeah, no problem.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.087
I went to the back.

19:49.087 --> 19:52.090
I could not find these
ears, could not find them.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.594
And I was like,
I know I saw these literally yesterday.

19:55.594 --> 19:58.163
There is no I saw these.
So I went to my coordinate.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.299
I was like,
Have you seen these orange bird ears?

20:00.299 --> 20:02.768
And she was like, Actually,
yeah, it's on the desk over here.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.169
It was on the coordinator desk.

20:04.169 --> 20:07.005
I was like, can I,
can I give this to to a guest?

20:07.005 --> 20:08.173
And she was like, Of course.

20:08.173 --> 20:10.542
So I came outside
and I kid you not this guests.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.710
She was in tears.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.179
She was like,
I've been searching for this orange bird

20:14.179 --> 20:17.749
because they go to the Flower
and Garden Festival

20:17.816 --> 20:22.588
every single year since they were married
and they always get the ears.

20:22.788 --> 20:27.859
And so this, you know, this was their
little trinket for their anniversary.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.096
So I was like, okay, yeah, here you are,
let's get you checked out.

20:31.129 --> 20:32.531
She was like, Thank you so much.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.101
And I felt like so, like, happy
that I was able to one

20:36.101 --> 20:39.538
five years to be able
to make this a special moment for them.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.440
So sweet.

20:41.440 --> 20:41.907
my gosh.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.276
They're going to remember that forever
for a long time.

20:44.276 --> 20:48.880
And so will I, you know, because
that was such like a great moment.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.183
I try to make magical

20:51.183 --> 20:55.053
moments as often as I can,
because not only do

20:55.053 --> 20:58.924
I know that it makes a guest experience,
but it also it makes my day.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.460
I love when I can come in and know that

21:01.460 --> 21:04.463
I've had just a slightly positive impact
on someone's day.

21:04.529 --> 21:07.232
But I'll give you a few short examples.

21:07.232 --> 21:12.137
One of my favorites is I was vacuuming
one day, one of the carpets,

21:12.204 --> 21:15.007
super mundane tasks, something
I've done a lot At this point, I'm

21:15.007 --> 21:18.410
just kind of droning on I saw a little boy
at the corner of my eye.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.413
And he is just fascinated by this

21:21.413 --> 21:24.783
vacuum
is the coolest thing he's ever seen.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.985
And so I look over
and like I look at the mom,

21:26.985 --> 21:29.655
make little eye contact, and I'm like,
Hey, come over here.

21:29.655 --> 21:32.224
And he comes over and I was like,
Do you want to help me vacuum?

21:32.224 --> 21:33.625
I said, Yes.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.260
And so I lower the vacuum to a smaller

21:35.260 --> 21:37.229
set, and I'm like,
Come on, let's get this place cleaned up.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.765
And we're just like vacuuming.
And he's having a great time.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.233
The mom is taking a video.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.734
It's a simple little things.

21:42.734 --> 21:46.104
Another moment I can think of is

21:46.104 --> 21:49.841
custodians can do water art,
which is a huge perk.

21:49.841 --> 21:53.478
And I was outside doing it one day and
I was just making some Mickey Mouse ears.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.281
And I look over and I see a little girl.

21:56.281 --> 21:57.683
She's loving it.
She's having a great time.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.685
And I was like, Hey,
do you want to help me finish this?

21:59.685 --> 22:01.420
I was like, I have a huge task for you.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.821
And she's like, Okay, I got it.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.824
And I'm like,
I need you to help me make Mickey's ears.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.627
Only you can do it.
This is the job for you.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.028
So she's like, Okay, I got it.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.264
And I gave her the broom. She's doing it.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.033
They're perfect. It's
just a simple little thing.

22:15.033 --> 22:16.368
And then I'm like,
Why don't you just, like, scribble

22:16.368 --> 22:18.637
around like you're an artist,
Show me some art.

22:18.637 --> 22:21.640
So she's like, scribble and up and down
the sidebar, she's drawing princesses.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.442
We're having a great time.

22:23.442 --> 22:26.244
But it's just
I love and able to do things like that.

22:26.244 --> 22:29.648
It really it makes my day.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.150
I'm about to go apply for the college
program. Just.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.686
Those are such sweet stories.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.554
Like, I want to do that.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.456
Yeah, I remember seeing somebody do that

22:37.456 --> 22:40.492
for the first time and I'm like, Man,
I don't even know if I have

22:40.492 --> 22:43.595
the skills to be able to do this,
but just the little things, right?

22:43.595 --> 22:45.030
It's Disney culture.

22:45.030 --> 22:49.868
Are there any things like
the pens or ears or anything

22:49.868 --> 22:53.138
that you like to collect that's like,
this is my piece of Disney culture?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.173
That's a great question.

22:55.173 --> 23:01.079
I have a pair of ears and I want to buy
some more ears, specifically up

23:01.146 --> 23:05.150
ears, like just like the book, because
it has like the little gravestone I want.

23:05.150 --> 23:08.053
So I'm trying to get into the ear
collecting and stuff like that.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.222
But that that's going to be
my first purchase.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.158
And then the second one is the Winnie
the Pooh is have you seen those?

23:13.158 --> 23:14.659
They're like the little tiny.

23:14.659 --> 23:16.628
Like little. It's beautiful.

23:16.628 --> 23:21.466
And then we just got Rapunzel ears back,
I believe, back in stock.

23:21.533 --> 23:22.167
it's so cute.

23:22.167 --> 23:27.172
So probably next, you know, it
will probably be the, the ears for sure.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.106
Yeah.

23:28.106 --> 23:31.676
there's this thing that guests do
sometimes called pixie dusting,

23:31.743 --> 23:33.678
where you're just like working

23:33.678 --> 23:37.516
and you either make a magical moment
for them or they just want to be generous.

23:37.516 --> 23:41.353
But they give you a little gift
So side note, my resort

23:41.353 --> 23:45.924
has this little activity
that we do called the wave.

23:46.024 --> 23:50.495
And every night at 730,
all the custodians gather outside

23:50.495 --> 23:54.733
by our entrance and we have a speaker
and lights and a bubble machine.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.902
And we have those little mickey gloves
that you wave.

23:56.902 --> 24:00.839
And we just have a dance party
for 30 minutes and people will come

24:00.939 --> 24:02.808
enjoy and lots of little kids.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.010
We're just waving people off
like coming back in the parks.

24:05.010 --> 24:05.544
It's awesome.

24:05.544 --> 24:08.146
But the other day,
while we were doing that,

24:08.146 --> 24:12.317
there was a couple who came up and
they gave all of us these little keychains

24:12.317 --> 24:16.288
that had a version of the little Mickey
hand on it because we all had them on.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.591
And I like to collect those things,
those little pixie dust,

24:19.691 --> 24:21.760
try to try to keep them in my heart.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.830
Those are really nice because usually
they will come around with like bracelets.

24:24.830 --> 24:25.230
Have you gotten.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.298
Yeah, yeah.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.468
They'll come around with bracelets
and stuff for us, which is like, so nice.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.336
And I have like six of them.

24:31.336 --> 24:34.539
I like different ones,
like Disney characters and like,

24:34.539 --> 24:36.575
you know, park themed stuff like that.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.642
I don't know why it's a thing,

24:37.642 --> 24:42.447
but around my resort, a lot of guests
bring these really teeny tiny dogs.

24:42.547 --> 24:44.449
Is that a thing? Yes.

24:44.449 --> 24:46.751
I didn't know that was like a trend
that people were doing.

24:46.751 --> 24:47.219
I don't know.

24:47.219 --> 24:47.886
What did you see?

24:47.886 --> 24:48.920
Yes. wow.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.856
You have them, like, all over our office.
They're everywhere.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.023
No way. Yeah.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.925
Hey, I need to get into this Okay.

24:53.925 --> 24:58.497
Is it hard working in the parks
or just like being on the college program?

24:58.730 --> 25:00.699
Because we were talking about,
like, ears and stuff.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.335
The temptation
to, like, buy them all. Is that.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.202
Is that real?

25:04.202 --> 25:07.672
Because I feel like I'd be, like,
spending all my money on everything,

25:07.672 --> 25:10.675
especially when a new lounge flight
comes. No.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.810
Five backpacks.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.146
Not the backpacks,
the backpacks and the lugs.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.382
The merch is too tempting for real.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.184
Don't let me set foot on Disney property.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.354
I will buy everything
So that kind of leads me.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.690
I mean, you know, you collect
all this amazing stuff while you're here,

25:25.757 --> 25:29.094
but then there's that balance of like,
Well, what do I even bring down

25:29.261 --> 25:30.262
to Florida?

25:30.262 --> 25:32.364
You know, like you're
trying to balance a little bit of both.

25:32.364 --> 25:36.668
So what was kind of your perspective
of your space that you have

25:36.668 --> 25:38.670
and how much you're
actually bringing with you?

25:38.670 --> 25:41.873
Because you know that there's only so much
you can take back as well.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.675
well, that was the question

25:43.675 --> 25:47.546
because I'm a shopaholic,

25:47.612 --> 25:48.580
I love to shop.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.383
I have like tons of tons of clothes.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.286
So when I was coming down
to the Disney College program,

25:54.286 --> 25:57.989
I had my own apartment
because I was just finishing up college.

25:58.089 --> 26:02.394
So my mom did
not want to store all my stuff.

26:02.460 --> 26:06.464
So I had to get like a little storage unit
just right next to my house.

26:06.464 --> 26:09.668
And I just put most of the stuff
that I couldn't bring down here,

26:09.834 --> 26:13.605
mostly just like winter stuff,
like because I'm from northern Georgia.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.508
So we do get a little, you know, brisk.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.543
And so I was like,
We're going to Florida.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.412
Don't even go cold.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.113
I put all my winter stuff away

26:22.113 --> 26:25.684
and I brought all my summer
and like fall type stuff here.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.218
And then, you know, that

26:27.218 --> 26:31.089
gave me a little bit lead way of room
for the Disney stuff.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.992
So, you know, once my program is over,
that's

26:33.992 --> 26:38.697
going to be my parents
problem to pull back out. So.

26:38.797 --> 26:39.264
first I

26:39.264 --> 26:42.267
have to say I am a certified over packer.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.171
So it was challenging trying to figure out
what I should narrow down

26:46.371 --> 26:47.639
and bring here.

26:47.639 --> 26:51.242
I one thing to say,
I bought a lot when I came here.

26:51.242 --> 26:54.479
It was just the excitement of starting
a new program and being at Disney.

26:54.713 --> 26:58.483
So I kind of wish
I almost brought a little less of

26:58.583 --> 26:59.884
so my Disney related things.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.386
If I knew I was going to

27:01.386 --> 27:05.090
literally double the amount I had like
within the first month of being here.

27:05.190 --> 27:09.027
And secondly, the clothing situation.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.329
I love clothes. I really love them.

27:11.329 --> 27:16.034
But you're working often
and when you work you wear a uniform.

27:16.134 --> 27:21.139
So like 5 to 6 days of the week,
I already have my clothes picked out.

27:21.239 --> 27:24.909
So you kind of don't need to worry
as much about having a lot

27:24.943 --> 27:27.212
a lot of clothes
that you need to be wearing all the time

27:27.212 --> 27:30.915
software out of the parks, stuff for your
traditions and all of your welcome.

27:30.915 --> 27:34.352
Make stuff like a nice little business
casual, but just dorm related stuff.

27:34.352 --> 27:39.991
Because I came here, probably my semester
ended, I went home for a week

27:40.125 --> 27:43.895
and then I had the privilege
of driving here in my car

27:43.962 --> 27:45.196
so I could bring a few more things.

27:45.196 --> 27:47.532
I know when people fly, it's
even more challenging,

27:47.532 --> 27:49.668
but I basically just packed
everything up from my dorm

27:49.668 --> 27:53.538
and then put it back in my car and kept
it is classic college stuff.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.608
Mattress topper, huge help on these beds.

27:56.708 --> 28:01.146
storage bed, big thing. Yeah.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.148
Well, just pack yourself up

28:03.148 --> 28:07.352
and then take one or two or ten things out
because you don't really need them.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.286
Yeah.

28:08.286 --> 28:11.156
What was it like transitioning
from your own apartment

28:11.156 --> 28:15.393
in your own space or like,
maybe your own dorm room to coming in

28:15.393 --> 28:19.230
and having roommates and sharing a space
and just meeting new people in general

28:19.230 --> 28:19.864
as well?

28:19.864 --> 28:21.232
I think it's fun.

28:21.232 --> 28:24.035
I'm a very like, what are you doing?

28:24.035 --> 28:25.503
let's, let's do this.

28:25.503 --> 28:28.206
So like,
it was kind of cool, especially because

28:28.206 --> 28:32.577
the first month I was actually by myself
because I'm in an A two by two.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.379
So I have a roommate with me,

28:34.379 --> 28:38.216
but I was by myself and I kids, you know,
I was like, I'm like kind of lonely.

28:38.216 --> 28:42.253
Like, this is this is like,
okay, I'm ready for a roommate, like

28:42.353 --> 28:43.621
whenever you want to give you one.

28:43.621 --> 28:46.825
And so when we finally when
I finally got one, it was really cool.

28:46.825 --> 28:49.828
I connected with her.
She's from Wisconsin.

28:49.994 --> 28:53.098
And so I was like, okay, with
this is someone, you know, different?

28:53.098 --> 28:54.632
They've never been where I've been.

28:54.632 --> 28:59.337
So, you know, we got to swap stories
and she also she works food and beverage.

28:59.604 --> 29:02.273
So when we come home, we're always like,

29:02.273 --> 29:05.276
would you do like,
you know, especially after training?

29:05.276 --> 29:08.279
Because we didn't know, like,
you know, how training was going to go.

29:08.346 --> 29:11.516
So we were talking about it
and like the things that she did

29:11.516 --> 29:13.318
was different from what like I did.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.754
And so it was kind of cool
to be able to talk to her.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.289
And then the people from across the site.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.692
It was kind of cool to talk to them
because they work in

29:20.692 --> 29:23.695
Magic Kingdom, so they were like,
We're so busy.

29:23.828 --> 29:27.298
But it was just fun, like being able
to talk to people and especially because

29:27.398 --> 29:31.069
Flamingo Crossings Village,
they have a lot of events

29:31.069 --> 29:34.005
where you can go and meet people
and get out of your room

29:34.005 --> 29:37.876
so you don't feel like,
I'm like by myself, you know, like you

29:37.876 --> 29:41.846
get out there, you go swimming
and you meet someone from France or,

29:41.880 --> 29:46.017
you know, from UK or from Mexico,
and it's just like an awesome time.

29:46.017 --> 29:48.453
And especially just because, like I said,
I'm bubbly.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.889
I literally talk to anybody.
So it was fun.

29:50.889 --> 29:53.658
It was it was nice.
Was a nice little transition for me.

29:53.658 --> 29:56.494
I have had experience
living in the same room

29:56.494 --> 29:59.497
with someone before
because I'm a junior in college,

29:59.531 --> 30:04.135
and so I'm kind of used
to adjusting my habits to fit

30:04.235 --> 30:07.138
another person being there and learning
how to respect their space,

30:07.138 --> 30:09.073
which is super duper important.

30:09.073 --> 30:13.511
I was very nervous
because you don't know any information

30:13.578 --> 30:18.183
about who you're going to be living with,
which originally I kind of

30:18.283 --> 30:22.086
it gave me a lot of anxiety,
but now I'm grateful for it

30:22.086 --> 30:25.290
because it allowed me to not make

30:25.290 --> 30:28.927
any preconceived notions and overthink
who was going to be living with.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.329
So when I moved
in, there were people already there.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.630
They had been working there,

30:32.630 --> 30:36.568
already got busy schedules,
but gotten really close with my roommates.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.269
It's been a great experience.

30:38.269 --> 30:43.208
Like she said before, Flamingo Crossing,
they have a lot of welcome events.

30:43.208 --> 30:47.345
They make sure you're not feeling lonely
or if you're feeling homesick,

30:47.345 --> 30:50.381
they've got something
that's going to help comfort you.

30:50.381 --> 30:53.451
And for a lot of people,
this is their first time

30:53.451 --> 30:56.521
living away from home
or sometimes being at Disney.

30:56.521 --> 31:00.425
It's easier to get homesick
than being away at school

31:00.458 --> 31:04.829
because for me personally, Disney
was always a thing I did with my family

31:04.829 --> 31:05.797
and I don't do

31:05.797 --> 31:09.634
my college classes with my family,
so I kind of forget about them here.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.202
But there's a lot of memories.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.403
you'll have people to talk to.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.472
You just have to get out
and take advantage

31:14.472 --> 31:17.475
of all the opportunities
they present to you.

31:17.575 --> 31:20.078
Yan I want to touch on that welcome week.

31:20.078 --> 31:23.481
So what is that first week
like when you arrive on the program?

31:23.748 --> 31:26.551
So that first week
it's actually kind of fun.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.419
It's a little stressful but then fun.

31:28.419 --> 31:31.155
So that first week
you're moving in all your stuff, you're

31:31.155 --> 31:34.792
getting your IDs
for getting into flamingos crossings

31:35.026 --> 31:38.162
and finding your room and,
you know, putting all your stuff away.

31:38.162 --> 31:42.700
And when I did it, it was it was like
a bittersweet moment because my mom,

31:42.867 --> 31:46.671
we drove together she helped me
put some stuff inside of my apartment.

31:46.905 --> 31:51.409
But then her flight was literally an hour
after like we got there.

31:51.676 --> 31:58.049
So she helped me with my bathroom
and she was like, All right.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.250
So, you

31:59.250 --> 32:02.487
know, I was like, mom,
But after once she left

32:02.487 --> 32:05.723
and I was by myself for a little bit,
I was like, okay, breathe.

32:05.757 --> 32:06.658
What do we have to do?

32:06.658 --> 32:10.695
And luckily, they give you like a schedule
for your first day to make sure, like,

32:10.695 --> 32:13.698
Hey, you need to be here, here, here,
and the rest of the day.

32:13.798 --> 32:15.466
Have fun, Enjoy yourself.

32:15.466 --> 32:16.968
And after that day,

32:16.968 --> 32:20.071
when we got through the background checks
and doing all of the, you know,

32:20.071 --> 32:24.242
the important documentation,
that's when we got to do the three day.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.378
It was a Disney Park
State Park admission.

32:27.378 --> 32:29.013
Yeah, the park admission days.

32:29.013 --> 32:32.450
And after that I was like,
Bye, mom, love you.

32:32.517 --> 32:35.987
I'm going to Slinky Dog in in Hollywood.

32:35.987 --> 32:37.755
And I had a blast of a time.

32:37.755 --> 32:41.793
I went with my roommates and we just
got to explore the parks before, you know,

32:42.026 --> 32:45.563
we started doing like Disney training
and stuff like that for our roles.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.532
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.068
It's better than my welcome week
in college.

32:50.068 --> 32:54.138
It's more fun
and less that I'll say that in.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.874
It was pretty good.

32:56.874 --> 32:58.409
It's Florida, it's hot.

32:58.409 --> 33:01.012
I think I forgot where I was moving to.

33:01.012 --> 33:03.348
So on opening day, I was like,

33:03.414 --> 33:04.782
my gosh, like moving boxes.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.551
And so I didn't so dress appropriately.

33:06.551 --> 33:09.754
But also know that you do
take your blue I.D.

33:09.787 --> 33:14.258
photo that will be your ID
for your entire career at Disney.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.161
So within the first
like hour of being there.

33:17.161 --> 33:17.862
So you take that.

33:17.862 --> 33:21.099
So just keep that in the back of your head
to fight yourself a little bit,

33:21.165 --> 33:25.636
just a little as much as you can,
because he will do your makeup,

33:25.703 --> 33:27.905
you know, wear makeup,
make sure you have like

33:27.905 --> 33:31.309
powder settings, spray
whatever you need to do.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.377
yeah.

33:32.377 --> 33:35.847
So in between your moving
day and traditions,

33:35.847 --> 33:38.216
you have three free days
where you can either

33:38.216 --> 33:41.886
choose to make 100 shopping trips,
get all your stuff organized,

33:42.086 --> 33:46.391
or you can also go to the parks and start
to feel super excited about Disney and

33:46.491 --> 33:49.394
and just get a taste of
the rest of your time with this program

33:49.394 --> 33:50.862
is going to be like,

33:50.862 --> 33:54.799
What is it like to be at Walt Disney World
and surrounded by all of these leaders

33:54.799 --> 33:58.336
and people who have also done
a Disney college program

33:58.336 --> 33:59.537
or an international program,

33:59.537 --> 34:02.540
or does they have that experience
with Disney programs as a whole?

34:02.740 --> 34:05.543
I think it's a really fun
like I said before,

34:05.543 --> 34:09.947
it's a learning experience, so everyone's
going to have a different experience.

34:10.148 --> 34:13.785
So hearing other
like especially the international program

34:13.851 --> 34:17.321
cast members, it's
always cool to hear how they got here.

34:17.321 --> 34:18.956
And learn from them.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.160
And then again,
like just swapping stories about,

34:22.193 --> 34:25.296
you know, how we made magic
the day or yesterday

34:25.296 --> 34:28.666
or the day before that
and how they made magic as well.

34:28.666 --> 34:33.504
So Being around and leaders
who have been where you are

34:33.704 --> 34:38.843
is really inspirational,
especially if you're someone

34:38.843 --> 34:43.147
who wants to try to further your career
within the Disney company.

34:43.381 --> 34:46.017
This is an awesome place to start.

34:46.017 --> 34:49.654
If you're someone who is interested in
Imagineering

34:49.754 --> 34:54.392
or, or, like hospitality, casting,
all these things.

34:54.492 --> 34:57.228
Talk to half the people who are working

34:57.228 --> 35:00.298
as a higher up and they'll tell you
this is exactly where they started.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.432
Does it matter your role?

35:01.432 --> 35:05.303
You don't have to be something
that relates to a corporate position.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.238
I have talked to
so many people who are like,

35:07.238 --> 35:11.776
I was in custodial
and now I am working as a brand manager

35:11.843 --> 35:16.881
or I was in food and beverage
and now I am a leader of the resort.

35:16.881 --> 35:17.482
Concierges.

35:17.482 --> 35:21.052
I am and I am in charge of helping
all these people navigate their program.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.020
It's really cool.

35:23.020 --> 35:27.458
It feels very down to earth,
very achievable,

35:27.558 --> 35:30.461
and at the same time
they have been where you are.

35:30.461 --> 35:35.566
So they understand a lot of what
you're going through and to have something

35:35.566 --> 35:39.837
that you relate with your your managers
and your leaders is something

35:39.837 --> 35:43.574
you don't get in a lot of careers,
especially at this young of an age.

35:43.741 --> 35:46.911
it's a really cool work dynamic.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.780
So let's dive a little bit deeper
on making connections.

35:49.780 --> 35:53.651
How would you compare and contrast,
like making friends or networking

35:53.651 --> 35:57.421
or whatever from the Disney
College program to college?

35:57.421 --> 36:00.024
Is it the same is a different
what is it like?

36:00.024 --> 36:02.126
I would say it's more exciting.

36:02.126 --> 36:06.597
That's my I know in college
it can be a little,

36:06.664 --> 36:10.334
I guess, intimidating in a sense,
just because like everybody

36:10.334 --> 36:13.571
is in their in their business suit,
everybody is like

36:13.671 --> 36:16.908
ready to resume, resume president,
you know, And I'm like, whoa.

36:16.908 --> 36:20.845
Like, you know, like I feel at Disney
when I'm networking,

36:20.845 --> 36:24.348
everyone is very, like, welcoming,
but like, it's very calm.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.817
It's like a conversation.

36:26.817 --> 36:30.588
I'll talk separately
about making friends and networking

36:30.588 --> 36:32.523
and how they're kind of combined.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.026
But first, the difference
between making friends at college

36:35.026 --> 36:39.664
and making friends here is
colleges are usually very big

36:39.864 --> 36:45.469
and it's kind of hard
to pick one direction and focus on it.

36:45.536 --> 36:50.975
But here at the DCP,
you are put in an environment

36:51.042 --> 36:54.579
where a lot of people
share the same interest.

36:54.579 --> 36:59.150
Yes, I mean, I'm
a big musical theater fan, big Disney fan.

36:59.283 --> 37:02.486
It's hard
to find literally an apartment complex

37:02.687 --> 37:06.524
where all of your neighbors are like,
I also am a theater

37:06.524 --> 37:08.259
fan and I love like Disney.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.928
So that's a really cool experience.

37:10.928 --> 37:13.731
And then as a networking
kind of professional

37:13.731 --> 37:18.269
stands, this is kind of the same thing

37:18.269 --> 37:21.639
where it's easier
to pick a certain direction and go in it.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.007
But that's my favorite

37:23.007 --> 37:27.278
part of this program
is so many opportunities for networking.

37:27.378 --> 37:30.748
I am a public relations major,
so at my school

37:30.815 --> 37:33.618
I do have a lot of places
that I am able to connect with.

37:33.618 --> 37:35.453
Fellow PR majors or people

37:35.453 --> 37:38.155
in the communications department,
which is awesome.

37:38.155 --> 37:41.826
But here there is such diversity

37:41.926 --> 37:46.397
in every aspect and I'm able to talk
to people in all different careers,

37:46.497 --> 37:50.101
which I think really helps make me

37:50.167 --> 37:53.337
a more well-rounded person Okay.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.873
So now that you guys
have been on the program for a bit,

37:55.873 --> 37:59.277
was there anything that surprised you
about this?

37:59.277 --> 38:02.179
Like a pleasant surprise coming in
you weren't expecting?

38:02.179 --> 38:06.250
I would say
probably that I am in different locations.

38:06.250 --> 38:06.817
I thought it was going

38:06.817 --> 38:10.421
to be just one location
and you're just, like, stuck there.

38:10.521 --> 38:14.225
Luckily, I was able to go from America
and Morocco

38:14.225 --> 38:17.895
as well as international Gateway,
so it's kind of nice from my day to day,

38:17.895 --> 38:19.664
I get to like see different things

38:19.664 --> 38:22.166
because sometimes I come
into the International Gateway Store,

38:22.166 --> 38:25.536
the World Traveler store, and I'm like,
That's new.

38:25.603 --> 38:29.040
Like, I didn't see that before,
or they like, switch around the store.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.975
Especially over at the Art of Disney.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.978
We have different
like prints as well as original artwork.

38:34.178 --> 38:35.146
So when you come in

38:35.146 --> 38:38.149
and you know your original artwork
is not there anymore and I'm like,

38:38.316 --> 38:41.986
wait, didn't we have like a King Kate
over there or like, I was already

38:42.053 --> 38:45.690
Are you gonna like, All right,
we got to learn a new way, you know?

38:45.890 --> 38:48.559
So it's kind of cool to, like,
you know, do different things

38:48.559 --> 38:53.431
and see different, like, art and then,
you know, different merchandise as well.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.333
I think for me,

38:55.333 --> 39:00.237
I don't know why I thought this,
but when I heard, I'm going to be doing

39:00.237 --> 39:04.709
the Disney College program, I was like,
I'm only going to be working with

39:04.809 --> 39:08.346
people who are in college
or who are around my age.

39:08.412 --> 39:11.615
But most of my fellow cast members

39:11.682 --> 39:14.452
are my age or older.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.922
And that surprised me
and at first intimidated me

39:18.155 --> 39:22.727
because I was like, my gosh,
I've I don't I'm not fit for this work.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.462
All these people have
all these years of experience.

39:24.462 --> 39:25.596
What am I going to do?

39:25.596 --> 39:27.865
But it was pleasantly surprising.

39:27.865 --> 39:32.336
And being able to talk to someone
who has been in this company

39:32.336 --> 39:36.173
for 25 years is really cool.

39:36.407 --> 39:37.842
And going off of that,

39:37.842 --> 39:41.178
something else that surprised me
is the amount of diversity I'm exposed to.

39:41.345 --> 39:44.982
Like I'm from Kentucky, so I didn't really
grow up around a lot of diversity.

39:44.982 --> 39:49.153
But to be in a space where you're around
people from different countries,

39:49.253 --> 39:52.289
from all across the U.S.,
all of different ages,

39:52.523 --> 39:56.360
all different races and genders,
like it is really, really cool.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.930
And it is so interesting to talk to people
who have lived

39:59.997 --> 40:03.667
a totally different life
than you and share your life with them.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.804
That has absolutely exceeded
my expectations

40:06.804 --> 40:10.107
and really, played a part in why
I love this program so much.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.208
That's awesome.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.277
Yeah, they always say that
Disney kind of gives you

40:13.277 --> 40:16.547
so many different resources
to help you be successful as well.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.549
So is that something that you feel like
kind of applies

40:18.549 --> 40:20.351
to your own stories and journey?

40:20.351 --> 40:25.389
I would especially the events
that we have at Flamingo Crossings,

40:25.389 --> 40:28.826
like you're able to work
with different people that you've never,

40:28.826 --> 40:30.161
you know, worked with before.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.831
And like she said,
like we have people from Japan

40:33.831 --> 40:36.801
and UK and,
you know, all these other countries.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.536
it's a really cool experience for sure.

40:38.536 --> 40:39.537
That's awesome.

40:39.537 --> 40:40.905
Okay. Abby, what about you?

40:40.905 --> 40:41.539
Yes. Okay.

40:41.539 --> 40:45.576
This is a perfect time to talk about
some of the learning sessions

40:45.576 --> 40:47.144
that Disney offers.

40:47.144 --> 40:50.581
They have a wide range of sessions

40:50.681 --> 40:54.685
that literally go from things like,

40:54.685 --> 40:57.688
you can learn a sign language basics

40:57.855 --> 41:02.460
or the history of Epcot or how to network.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.663
And they talk a lot
about professional things.

41:05.663 --> 41:09.500
So like, like I said, networking,
they have things like

41:09.500 --> 41:13.537
how to build up your LinkedIn profile
or how to build your resume.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.940
They are so beyond useful.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.809
That's the perfect way to network
because a lot of the people

41:18.809 --> 41:19.910
who are leading

41:19.910 --> 41:21.011
those sessions

41:21.011 --> 41:24.715
are not only fellow DHCP alumni,
but they are people who are working

41:24.715 --> 41:26.050
their way up in the company

41:26.050 --> 41:30.054
and they have this thing called
it's like a little degree

41:30.054 --> 41:33.657
you can get if you take
so many hours of these sessions.

41:33.891 --> 41:38.929
They're called a doctorate or a masters,
which is an adorable name,

41:38.996 --> 41:43.167
but kind of gives you motivation
to work towards that achievement

41:43.267 --> 41:48.138
and just really help build some of your
professional personal financial.

41:48.138 --> 41:51.909
They have a lot of like financial classes,
build all of those skills

41:51.909 --> 41:55.246
and just help you in this program
and in life.

41:55.312 --> 41:56.247
Very cool.

41:56.247 --> 41:57.014
Yeah.

41:57.014 --> 42:02.086
So we often say the Disney College program
is a stepping stone into what's next.

42:02.086 --> 42:05.189
And you guys have talked about this
even today where you've been able

42:05.189 --> 42:08.192
to meet so many people
who started on the college program

42:08.192 --> 42:11.695
and are now really high up in the company
doing really cool things.

42:11.695 --> 42:17.401
How do you feel like this program has set
you up for whatever the next step is?

42:17.468 --> 42:21.438
I think definitely it has build
my leadership skills

42:21.539 --> 42:26.343
and also the way that I present myself,
because I will say,

42:26.343 --> 42:31.649
like I said, I'm a very bubbly person
and sometimes I just talk really fast.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.685
So, you know,
it allowed me to figure out like,

42:34.685 --> 42:38.556
Hey, you need to calm down, slow down
a little bit and let other people talk,

42:38.789 --> 42:41.225
because I would just just talk,
talk, talk, talk.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.228
So it's an experience
that showed me like, okay,

42:44.361 --> 42:49.433
so let's figure out how to have a good
or a great conversation

42:49.600 --> 42:53.537
by allowing them to talk about themselves
and then allowing yourself to

42:53.604 --> 42:55.706
like give a little bit of tidbit
of information

42:55.706 --> 42:58.509
that leads them to ask you more questions
about yourself.

42:58.509 --> 43:02.880
So you're like networking just literally
everywhere, like I said before.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.082
So yeah,

43:05.182 --> 43:07.818
I'm super grateful for

43:07.818 --> 43:11.021
all these skills that I feel like
I'm learning while I'm here.

43:11.121 --> 43:15.559
I could go on and on,
but in general, this is teaching me a lot

43:15.559 --> 43:19.029
about responsibility because I have never

43:19.029 --> 43:22.032
really had a job like this before.

43:22.099 --> 43:27.771
Not just,
I mean, in like custodial, but such a long

43:27.838 --> 43:31.342
commitment
that takes a lot of time and energy.

43:31.408 --> 43:34.912
So it's been teaching me
how to navigate that.

43:34.912 --> 43:36.914
I'm also taking classes while I'm here.

43:36.914 --> 43:41.552
So time management has become
a big learning lesson of mine

43:41.752 --> 43:45.255
and what better place to do that
than here?

43:45.322 --> 43:49.226
But within work,
I have really learned a lot about teamwork

43:49.293 --> 43:53.530
and through learning how to work well with
others, I feel like I am building myself

43:53.530 --> 43:57.601
up as a leader, which is something I'm
super passionate about.

43:57.668 --> 44:01.338
That's what I really want to take with me
when I leave is knowing that I'm

44:01.338 --> 44:05.075
a good leader and I and I learn
how to do that by watching my own leaders

44:05.275 --> 44:09.446
and seeing how me and my fellow
cast members respond to them.

44:09.513 --> 44:13.717
I do it by figuring out what are my
strengths, what are my weaknesses.

44:13.717 --> 44:17.721
I used to always say
I was very adaptable.

44:17.755 --> 44:21.759
Every time I go to an interview,
I'd be like, I am adaptable.

44:21.859 --> 44:24.662
But then I got deployed,

44:24.662 --> 44:29.333
which basically
means that for a little over

44:29.400 --> 44:30.501
two weeks

44:30.501 --> 44:34.872
I was sent to a different resort
right after I just got comfortable.

44:34.972 --> 44:40.010
Finally, no,
everyone was getting into a routine.

44:40.077 --> 44:43.380
They dropped me in this place
where I was familiar with nothing

44:43.447 --> 44:46.784
and I was like,
I don't feel very adaptable now.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.218
And then they did that a few more times

44:48.218 --> 44:50.087
and I was like,
Why do they keep doing this to me?

44:50.087 --> 44:55.292
But by the end of it I was like,
This has been a great learning experience.

44:55.359 --> 44:59.329
I now feel more confident
being able to walk in an environment

44:59.329 --> 45:05.102
where I don't know anyone
and no one knows me yet still stand out,

45:05.202 --> 45:09.306
make it impact on my work,
make a difference to those around me,

45:09.406 --> 45:12.543
and just take something
from that experience.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.312
You learn something new
at every every resort.

45:15.312 --> 45:17.715
I go, I picked up something else
and I bring it back.

45:17.715 --> 45:22.386
And even if the skills I'm learning are,
this is a better way

45:22.386 --> 45:26.290
to change this trashcan
than what I was doing before.

45:26.390 --> 45:30.494
But that's just transferable
to keeping an open mind and learning

45:30.494 --> 45:33.330
that you don't know everything
because I didn't know a lot coming here.

45:33.330 --> 45:38.836
I don't know how to clean,
but figuring out how to start from nothing

45:38.902 --> 45:39.436
and work

45:39.436 --> 45:43.674
your way up to then become someone
who maybe your other coworkers look up to.

45:43.741 --> 45:48.612
That's my favorite, like professional
or experience I'm getting from here.

45:48.679 --> 45:49.980
That's amazing.

45:49.980 --> 45:53.283
So we know that you have some time
left on your program.

45:53.383 --> 45:56.253
So I'm going to say that before
I ask this question.

45:56.253 --> 45:58.222
What are you going to miss the most?

45:58.222 --> 46:00.657
My gosh, actually, I know exactly

46:00.657 --> 46:03.961
my cast members, my fellow cast members,

46:04.027 --> 46:06.930
when I tell you they really make my day,

46:06.930 --> 46:10.801
I walk in and everyone's just like,
give me.

46:10.801 --> 46:14.772
And I'm like, Hey, guys, Like,
I really enjoy it.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.274
And like, we laugh together.

46:17.274 --> 46:20.844
And in the Disney College program,
people's programs are different.

46:20.844 --> 46:22.646
So everyone has like a different end date.

46:22.646 --> 46:25.983
So I've had a lot of cast members
that are that

46:26.116 --> 46:29.119
I've come like really close with
who have already left.

46:29.319 --> 46:32.890
And so I'm like, you know, I'm
missing them because like cast member

46:32.890 --> 46:36.860
is like really make it like,
like and a great experience.

46:36.927 --> 46:40.998
So now that we have new kids
that have come into like World Traveler

46:40.998 --> 46:45.202
as well as the Art of Disney Store, it's
kind of fun to connect with them as well

46:45.402 --> 46:50.440
and just make it a great
day every day, you know?

46:50.541 --> 46:51.809
Is it stereotypical if

46:51.809 --> 46:55.345
I just say the parks,
I mean, the parks are full.

46:55.579 --> 46:59.149
I feel like I'm here
living in this Disney bubble

46:59.249 --> 47:01.218
because life just isn't real here.

47:01.218 --> 47:05.122
If I have a bad day,
I'm going to Magic Kingdom.

47:05.189 --> 47:07.958
I'm going to miss that.

47:07.958 --> 47:11.962
It's it is an experience
unlike anything else.

47:12.029 --> 47:15.032
Grab a turkey leg, you know? Yeah.

47:15.098 --> 47:18.302
You get a
what is your advice for someone who's

47:18.302 --> 47:20.571
maybe on the fence
about doing the college program?

47:20.571 --> 47:22.172
We always say just do it.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.341
But beyond that, what advice do you have?

47:24.341 --> 47:28.545
just like she said,
keep an open mind, Take every opportunity

47:28.545 --> 47:32.349
for what it is, grasp it and go for it,
because you really never know

47:32.349 --> 47:35.586
where it will take you or where or what
you'll learn.

47:35.586 --> 47:38.922
Just keep putting yourself out there
and I think you should.

47:38.922 --> 47:40.624
Just like you said, just do it.

47:40.624 --> 47:44.828
Sometimes it's
good to step out of your comfort zone.

47:44.895 --> 47:50.400
It's really scary moving to a new place,
starting a job suddenly,

47:50.434 --> 47:54.137
if you've never done something like this
before, living with complete strangers,

47:54.304 --> 47:54.905
it is a lot.

47:54.905 --> 47:57.908
I'm not going to I'm
not going to lie and say, Say it isn't.

47:57.941 --> 48:01.311
But if you motivate yourself

48:01.411 --> 48:05.082
to push past some of your feel fears,

48:05.148 --> 48:08.886
you will be really grateful to yourself.

48:08.952 --> 48:13.123
Because only, only
you are going to be able to,

48:13.190 --> 48:17.961
you know, overstep
your own boundaries in that

48:18.028 --> 48:18.729
space of

48:18.729 --> 48:23.033
uncomfortability
is where we grow as people.

48:23.133 --> 48:26.603
All right, I heard the saying
where you make your own happiness.

48:26.703 --> 48:29.907
And I try to live by
that as often as I can.

48:29.973 --> 48:32.976
And that's been really handy
while I've been here,

48:33.010 --> 48:35.178
because there are challenging days.

48:35.178 --> 48:39.349
I think if you focus on them,
you're not going to have a good time.

48:39.349 --> 48:43.320
If you let yourself get down in the dumps,
it's not going to be a good program.

48:43.387 --> 48:45.589
But if you come here
and you challenge yourself

48:45.589 --> 48:49.559
to make your own happiness,
to make yourself go out to the parks,

48:49.726 --> 48:53.230
make yourself introduce yourself
to other people, like

48:53.430 --> 48:56.266
go to all those learning sessions
at Disney offers.

48:56.266 --> 48:59.803
If you do that for yourself,

48:59.870 --> 49:04.875
you will be so grateful
and it'll be the program of a lifetime.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.044
So just try it. Don't be scared.

49:07.044 --> 49:07.711
Just try it.

49:07.711 --> 49:11.348
So I feel you on the certificates
because I have my mini masters

49:11.348 --> 49:14.651
sitting on my desk at work
and it just makes me feel like, so proud.

49:14.651 --> 49:16.086
Like I accomplished something.

49:16.086 --> 49:19.656
I did something intelligent.
Yeah, exactly.

49:19.723 --> 49:22.626
So what is something that either
and I'll let you kind of pick

49:22.626 --> 49:25.796
which way you want to go with this,
Something that you wish you knew.

49:25.896 --> 49:29.866
Those first couple of weeks
being on your program or a resource

49:29.866 --> 49:33.403
that was actually pretty helpful during
your first couple of weeks on the program.

49:33.470 --> 49:36.807
So I would say the passive go app,
which is like a transportation,

49:36.873 --> 49:42.412
an app, because I came down here
without my car and so I was like,

49:42.412 --> 49:45.682
I don't know how I'm going
to get from one place to another place.

49:45.682 --> 49:46.850
I'm going to get to the grocery store.

49:46.850 --> 49:49.386
Like, where? How?

49:49.386 --> 49:52.889
So It was kind of nice
when they told us, I believe it was

49:52.889 --> 49:57.260
when we first moved in about the passive
go app and like

49:57.427 --> 50:01.631
how the transportation works
and it's not too hard to learn.

50:01.631 --> 50:05.769
And one thing about me is
I like simplicity during that first week

50:05.769 --> 50:09.606
they give us like an email with like how
our like schedule is going to be laid out

50:09.773 --> 50:11.341
and it'll tell you where you're

50:11.341 --> 50:14.911
supposed to be going and as well as like
how you're supposed to dress.

50:15.145 --> 50:18.215
So like I said, it was very organized
and I knew exactly where I was going.

50:18.482 --> 50:20.884
I really like the app

50:20.951 --> 50:22.285
got on the app train.

50:22.285 --> 50:26.790
We have this app called Castle Life,
which is basically

50:26.790 --> 50:33.030
our kind of internal website
that has every

50:33.096 --> 50:36.600
in all information that you might
possibly need while you're here.

50:36.833 --> 50:40.871
It talks about discounts, events
coming up.

50:41.138 --> 50:45.642
It's where you can see your schedule,
very important and request days off.

50:45.742 --> 50:47.677
That is literally my lifeline.

50:47.677 --> 50:50.680
That and this other website called Dorms,

50:50.680 --> 50:54.418
which is where you can go and locate
all of Disney's offerings.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.019
So like those those learning sessions

50:56.019 --> 51:00.090
I talked about, but also they have
these really cool opportunities

51:00.157 --> 51:05.328
where you can get kind of a backstage
insider tour of some of the rides.

51:05.429 --> 51:08.532
So I check that thing
every single day, literally all the time.

51:08.532 --> 51:11.268
I'm one of those
iPad kids who is constantly

51:11.368 --> 51:12.602
either boarding pass.

51:12.602 --> 51:16.406
I can't help it,
but something I wish I knew

51:16.473 --> 51:18.909
early on is during my training

51:18.909 --> 51:22.913
I was scheduled for very early mornings
7 a.m.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.382
because I was like,
not that early, but I'm a No.

51:25.382 --> 51:28.652
Seven. And it's really I agree. I agree.

51:28.718 --> 51:32.389
I wish I knew that
that was most likely going to change

51:32.389 --> 51:34.558
because now I work all PM shifts.

51:34.558 --> 51:36.493
But at first I was like, I can't do this.

51:36.493 --> 51:40.130
I cannot wake up every day
at like 5:45 a.m..

51:40.363 --> 51:43.433
I just wish I knew that
my schedule was going to Agile.

51:43.533 --> 51:46.403
It was it was going to regulate. Well,
it all works out.

51:46.403 --> 51:47.471
I agree with that.

51:47.471 --> 51:52.209
Like when I first got here,
I'm not an early morning person either,

51:52.209 --> 51:57.514
so I was waking up at 5:00 and I'm like,
All right, got to get it together.

51:57.514 --> 52:01.685
But then after training
and doing more of like the closing shifts,

52:01.685 --> 52:02.452
it kind of made it

52:02.452 --> 52:07.090
a little bit easier for me to be like,
okay, pack day in the morning, go to work.

52:07.090 --> 52:12.429
All right, Sleep Like, it was just
it gets easier as you go on and you, like,

52:12.429 --> 52:15.866
figure out like, this is my positions,
this is how I do things.

52:16.066 --> 52:17.200
Like it gets way easier.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.603
And especially, like I said, like I'm
not a morning person.

52:19.603 --> 52:22.405
So once you go through that morning
shifts,

52:22.405 --> 52:24.040
you're you're good to go after that.

52:24.040 --> 52:25.408
You you get through that.

52:25.408 --> 52:27.377
You can get through anything.

52:27.377 --> 52:29.579
okay. Simple question.

52:29.579 --> 52:32.516
Did this program meet your expectations?

52:32.516 --> 52:36.052
exceeded my expectations
maybe it's just because I came in

52:36.052 --> 52:39.289
with such an open mind, but I was ready.

52:39.523 --> 52:42.359
Well, I was a little nervous But

52:42.359 --> 52:45.562
I love it so much.

52:45.562 --> 52:47.330
I have learned so much.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.965
I'm so happy. I love my work.

52:48.965 --> 52:51.034
I feel so fulfilled by it.

52:51.034 --> 52:54.137
I love all of the amenities
they have here.

52:54.237 --> 52:56.106
It is such a great environment.

52:56.106 --> 52:58.675
I'm astounded by how friendly everyone is.

52:58.675 --> 53:02.279
So yeah, this program has really blown me
out of the water.

53:02.345 --> 53:03.980
We love to hear it.

53:03.980 --> 53:07.551
Okay, so Jaci mentioned you guys
both have a little bit more time

53:07.551 --> 53:08.952
left on your program.

53:08.952 --> 53:13.356
What are some goals you want to accomplish
before your program ends?

53:13.456 --> 53:17.761
So I have worked in every single park.

53:17.827 --> 53:21.631
So now my next goal is to work
at every resort.

53:21.731 --> 53:24.935
So so far I've done the Polynesian
and the Grand Floridian,

53:25.168 --> 53:30.774
and I will say it's spectacular,
especially with the decorations.

53:30.874 --> 53:33.710
It's like on beam every single one.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.445
I'm like, especially the Polynesian.

53:35.445 --> 53:39.749
I feel like I'm Hawaii, like Bahamas,
you know, just living the high life,

53:39.783 --> 53:40.684
you know, really.

53:40.684 --> 53:46.056
And in the Grand Floridian beauty
force, stunning like very met gala,

53:46.056 --> 53:49.125
like you have the piano
and the guy is playing his piano.

53:49.125 --> 53:51.628
I'm like, yes, I'm very posh right
now. Yeah.

53:51.628 --> 53:52.896
It's like it's so nice.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.765
So I'm ready to, like, you know,
go to the other resorts and explore,

53:55.765 --> 53:59.302
you know, their merchandise. Cause
I like to shop. Well, you know,

53:59.402 --> 54:00.337
an all star movie.

54:00.337 --> 54:02.339
we'll do, we'll do some over there.

54:02.339 --> 54:03.473
You know? Yeah.

54:03.473 --> 54:05.542
I just want to explore the resort.

54:05.542 --> 54:08.678
earned my doctorate
or one of those degrees.

54:08.878 --> 54:14.217
I got to go to all of those sessions,
and I want to become super informed Yeah.

54:14.317 --> 54:15.318
And then my last one.

54:15.318 --> 54:20.090
So is there a meal, a food, a snack

54:20.156 --> 54:24.361
or anything that you feel like
someone has to try this?

54:24.361 --> 54:27.364
Like, this is the one thing
that I need you to try.

54:27.364 --> 54:29.733
If you come visit Walt Disney World.

54:29.733 --> 54:32.702
Okay,
so this is only for the Food and Wine

54:32.702 --> 54:36.473
Festival at Epcot
because I've been just circling.

54:36.539 --> 54:38.742
So I would have to say there's
actually two things that.

54:38.742 --> 54:40.343
Okay.

54:40.343 --> 54:43.346
no, no, I'm telling you, I've been just.

54:43.380 --> 54:44.681
let me get to this.

54:44.681 --> 54:47.584
What's this? Awesome.
Let's do it. France.

54:47.584 --> 54:48.585
They have a bakery.

54:48.585 --> 54:51.788
Get the macaroon
and think it's like a raspberry macaroon.

54:51.988 --> 54:52.856
And it's huge.

54:52.856 --> 54:53.490
It's great.

54:53.490 --> 54:57.394
I love it. It's
fresh. It's not too sweet. It's

54:57.494 --> 54:58.361
perfect.

54:58.361 --> 55:04.100
Second thing, it's either going to have to
be the poutine right out of Canada.

55:04.167 --> 55:05.769
Braised beef poutine.

55:05.769 --> 55:10.707
so hands down, you get fries,
you get meat, you get cheese.

55:10.707 --> 55:12.575
You can't ask for anything better.

55:12.575 --> 55:15.378
It's. It's beautiful.

55:15.378 --> 55:18.882
I have a big sweet tooth
and I'm going to say

55:18.982 --> 55:24.621
there's this coconut trees leches cake
that I know is at the festival Favorites.

55:24.688 --> 55:25.655
Delicious.

55:25.655 --> 55:27.691
I could eat so many of those.

55:27.691 --> 55:29.659
So many. Yeah.

55:29.659 --> 55:30.560
Try that.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.230
you guys have been amazing
and given us such good answers so far.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.334
We have a couple more questions
from our Instagram

55:37.334 --> 55:40.136
official Disney programs
from some of our followers.

55:40.136 --> 55:41.871
So would you be willing to answer
some of those?

55:41.871 --> 55:43.440
Of course.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.240
Awesome.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.343
All right,
let's get started with the first one.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.011
This one is from Elizabeth.

55:48.011 --> 55:50.580
Thank you, Elizabeth. Okay.

55:50.580 --> 55:55.485
Tips for self-care and time management
on the Disney College program.

55:55.552 --> 55:58.555
Okay, So self-care one,

55:58.822 --> 56:02.392
I would say on your break days,
take your break day.

56:02.559 --> 56:04.761
Don't stress yourself out.

56:04.761 --> 56:09.466
Just, you know, sometimes you just need
to indoors day because most of time,

56:09.532 --> 56:13.470
well, like me, I'm usually in the park,
I'm outside, I'm getting a lot of sun.

56:13.703 --> 56:17.374
So take your indoors day,
put on a good movie, put on you know

56:17.374 --> 56:21.544
you're your your moisturizer,
whatever you need to do and just,

56:21.578 --> 56:24.981
you know, enjoy yourself,
watch a good movie, eat your favorite food

56:25.181 --> 56:28.785
and just relax because sometimes
it can be a very hectic week.

56:29.018 --> 56:30.387
And taking that time for yourself

56:30.387 --> 56:34.124
is very important,
especially for your mental health.

56:34.190 --> 56:35.091
Make sure

56:35.091 --> 56:39.062
you're getting enough sleep
this is kind of combining time

56:39.062 --> 56:44.701
management and self-care,
but your schedule is going to be funky.

56:44.768 --> 56:47.203
I work for I work until like

56:47.203 --> 56:50.740
midnight to get home at like one
every night.

56:50.840 --> 56:54.778
Even though that that's late,
you still need 8 hours.

56:54.778 --> 56:56.246
You still need
you still need to get your sleep

56:56.246 --> 56:58.281
just because you're coming home

56:58.281 --> 57:01.351
like late doesn't mean
you still have to wake up at 8 a.m..

57:01.351 --> 57:04.087
Like, you'll adjust to your schedule.

57:04.087 --> 57:08.324
You'll figure out what time
management hacks work for you, but

57:08.324 --> 57:11.795
definitely make sure you're getting enough
sleep, getting enough water.

57:11.795 --> 57:16.065
It's so hot out here
in Florida is hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.

57:16.132 --> 57:20.036
Yes, Sleep, eat, drink water.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.939
Take care of yourself. Really?

57:22.939 --> 57:24.808
Awesome. Okay. Next question.

57:24.808 --> 57:26.142
Decided to give it to you

57:26.142 --> 57:32.015
so this one is from Emma, and she wants to
know, should I bring my car?

57:32.115 --> 57:34.951
I would say yes.

57:34.951 --> 57:38.855
Coming from a person
who doesn't have a car, leg.

57:38.855 --> 57:42.725
I will say the transportation is great
if you're like flying from somewhere like

57:42.725 --> 57:46.162
and you don't have the option
to bring your car, girl, you're good.

57:46.162 --> 57:47.564
You're like, Get on that bus.

57:47.564 --> 57:49.165
You're going to get where you need to go.

57:49.165 --> 57:52.001
But if you have the option to
bring your car, I say do it just in case.

57:52.001 --> 57:52.669
If you know

57:52.669 --> 57:54.471
you need to go do something else
that's outside

57:54.471 --> 57:57.040
of where the transportation takes you,
You know what I mean?

57:57.040 --> 57:59.442
So I say, go ahead and bring your car.

57:59.442 --> 58:01.511
It's so worth it.

58:01.511 --> 58:03.246
I love having my car here.

58:03.246 --> 58:07.650
I think it gives me
a certain sense of freedom.

58:07.750 --> 58:10.954
there's a lot of cool things in Florida
that you can go and explore,

58:10.954 --> 58:13.122
and having my car allows me to do that.

58:13.122 --> 58:16.025
Also, you get free parking
and all the perks because you work here.

58:16.025 --> 58:16.593
Okay, cool.

58:16.593 --> 58:19.562
So definitely
sounds like you don't need a car,

58:19.562 --> 58:21.664
but if you want to bring one,
you want to explore?

58:21.664 --> 58:23.566
Amazing. Go right ahead.

58:23.566 --> 58:24.567
Cool.

58:24.567 --> 58:26.069
Okay, Last question.

58:26.069 --> 58:27.537
It comes from Julia.

58:27.537 --> 58:30.039
Julia asks, How does housing work?

58:30.039 --> 58:32.742
Do we get to choose
what we would like to have?

58:32.742 --> 58:34.944
So housing is like pretty good.

58:34.944 --> 58:38.815
So basically we fill out a form And you're
going to put in your preferences

58:38.882 --> 58:41.784
for which type of area
you would like to stay in.

58:41.784 --> 58:45.522
So you have your 4x4,
which is four rooms in that room.

58:45.522 --> 58:48.057
You get your own bathroom
and then a four by two,

58:48.057 --> 58:49.425
which is your own room,

58:49.425 --> 58:52.428
but you're going to be sharing a bathroom
with your suite mate.

58:52.428 --> 58:56.232
And then the two by two, that means
you're going to have a person in the room

58:56.232 --> 58:56.699
with you.

58:56.699 --> 58:59.369
You're sharing a room
as well as a bathroom,

58:59.369 --> 59:02.972
so you don't always get your
first preference, which is totally fine.

59:02.972 --> 59:05.008
Like I said,
everything is a learning experience.

59:05.008 --> 59:07.210
So but it's like
I said, it's always fun to like,

59:07.210 --> 59:10.513
you know, learn about other people
and talk to other people as well.

59:10.613 --> 59:12.348
And then if you have
a medical accommodation,

59:12.348 --> 59:15.985
you can go through that process and yeah,
they make it like super easy.

59:15.985 --> 59:18.988
So you understand like what you're
getting into and where you're going.

59:18.988 --> 59:20.423
And they also have their website.

59:20.423 --> 59:24.727
So just in case, if you wanted to see
like the, the formulation of what to buy

59:24.727 --> 59:28.298
to the 4x4, the four by two look like
they're always on the website.

59:28.364 --> 59:30.099
So yeah,

59:30.199 --> 59:30.767
and I think it's

59:30.767 --> 59:36.072
important to have full transparency
and say you're most likely

59:36.072 --> 59:39.776
going to get a two by two and you're
most likely going to share a room.

59:39.842 --> 59:42.478
But I think if you know

59:42.478 --> 59:47.584
that ahead of time you'll be able
to prepare yourself and kind of examine

59:47.584 --> 59:51.220
your own living habits and maybe what
you can change or what's important to you.

59:51.321 --> 59:55.558
But I think living with someone
is kind of a part of the experience.

59:55.625 --> 59:58.628
I mean, I'm very fortunate to have a close
relationship with my roommate,

59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.631
but even if you don't,
you're working a lot

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:05.468
and you're going to the parks
and you'll meet lots of other friends,

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:08.237
so you're not home terribly often,

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.974
but the space is very nice.

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:13.009
You have a common space.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.446
They provide like utensils and dishes

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:20.917
or washing machines
and a huge TV and a huge TV.

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.886
Very nice. Not to mention the TV. Yeah.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.456
And for rent, it's really nice

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.425
because they take it out of your paycheck
each week.

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.427
And so I know they beach.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:35.331
They're always sure to schedule you enough
hours so you're able to meet your rent.

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:37.333
It is very low stress.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:41.137
As someone who is not very good
with math and logistics,

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:43.640
you don't have to really feel
anything out weekly.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.442
They just do it for you,
which was a huge relief for me.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:51.047
And also just the whole Flamingo
Crossings complex has a lot of stuff.

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.816
There's two swimming pools,
so you can look forward to that.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.252
Yeah, my husband has it's nice here, cool.

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.021
Well,
thank you so much for taking the time

01:00:58.021 --> 01:00:59.889
