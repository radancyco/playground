01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:06.644
<b>(upbeat music)</b>

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:10.106
<b>- I would describe Duke</b>

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.318
<b>culture as diverse, excellent,</b>

01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:16.404
<b>and inclusive and supportive.</b>

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.781
<b>Can I add more? (laughs)</b>

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.534
<b>- I would describe it as compassionate.</b>

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.328
<b>- Great teamwork.</b>

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:24.704
<b>- I would say it's innovative.</b>

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.080
<b>- It's growth-centered.</b>

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:28.291
<b>- Family-oriented and friendly.</b>

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.419
<b>(upbeat music)</b>

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.550
<b>- What's made Duke great for</b>

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.761
<b>me is all of the experience</b>

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.055
<b>that I was able to get.</b>

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.599
<b>Coming in, I was a part-time</b>

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:47.226
<b>clerical employee in the lab,</b>

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:48.770
<b>and I was able to move</b>

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.229
<b>around and promote within.</b>

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:53.441
<b>So if I wanted to describe the people</b>

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.817
<b>here at Duke Health,</b>

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.944
<b>I would say caring</b>

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.154
<b>and they're supportive,</b>

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.115
<b>especially the management staff here.</b>

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:06.371
<b>In 2012, I lost my son, and I looked up</b>

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.415
<b>and I noticed that my manager at the time</b>

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.709
<b>had closed the department</b>

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:15.004
<b>so that my immediate peers</b>

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.506
<b>could attend and</b>

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:17.840
<b>support me at the funeral.</b>

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.176
<b>So at that time is when I really realized</b>

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.137
<b>that I was more than just someone at Duke</b>

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:24.806
<b>with a Duke unique ID.</b>

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:29.394
<b>- One thing Duke has always done,</b>

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.395
<b>I've found is always asking,</b>

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:31.729
<b>what do you need to do your job?</b>

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.481
<b>And they expect a real answer.</b>

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:34.232
<b>It's just not, no,</b>

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.608
<b>everything's fine, great, thank you.</b>

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.485
<b>They really wanna know how you're feeling</b>

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.569
<b>and know what do you need.</b>

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:39.612
<b>- There's so many</b>

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:40.863
<b>things that make you proud</b>

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.032
<b>for working here, so many things.</b>

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:44.242
<b>The differences we</b>

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.660
<b>make each and every day</b>

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.579
<b>that your teams, other teams make,</b>

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:49.914
<b>that just makes you so</b>

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:51.374
<b>very proud to work here.</b>

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:52.750
<b>- Every day we have a</b>

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:53.876
<b>chance to help somebody.</b>

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:56.671
<b>Our patients come to us with some sort of</b>

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.840
<b>life threatening situation</b>

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.591
<b>that we're able to help them.</b>

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:02.510
<b>And that makes me feel good.</b>

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.849
<b>- Being born and raised in Durham,</b>

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.268
<b>I had always loved Duke and always dreamt</b>

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:11.894
<b>of having a career at Duke.</b>

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:13.062
<b>When one of my patients</b>

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.188
<b>ended up in the hospital</b>

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.065
<b>and I found out there was an opening,</b>

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.525
<b>it just kinda seemed meant to be.</b>

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:19.986
<b>Duke automatically put me</b>

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.529
<b>in a nurse residency program,</b>

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:22.447
<b>which was the support</b>

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:23.739
<b>and mentorship program.</b>

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.533
<b>For me, it was really</b>

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.868
<b>about feeling supported,</b>

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.202
<b>utilizing the skills that</b>

01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:29.829
<b>I learned in nursing school</b>

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:30.997
<b>and being able to</b>

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.249
<b>apply them in my workforce,</b>

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.792
<b>what I'm doing day to day.</b>

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:37.962
<b>- I think one thing that</b>

01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.130
<b>kind of just continually</b>

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.256
<b>makes me proud to be</b>

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.466
<b>here is every time I've gone</b>

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.426
<b>to a conference and presented work</b>

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.052
<b>or just shared with an</b>

01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:46.137
<b>external organization,</b>

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:47.221
<b>one question they</b>

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:49.098
<b>always ask is with quality,</b>

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.808
<b>how did you get managers and directors</b>

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:52.768
<b>and executive leaders to support you?</b>

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.479
<b>And my answer has always been like,</b>

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:56.314
<b>I didn't have to, they already did.</b>

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.941
<b>I work with so many innovative people.</b>

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.735
<b>I get to hear so many</b>

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.236
<b>cool ideas that people have</b>

01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:03.529
<b>that they wanna try and implement</b>

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:05.072
<b>and I get to help support them do that.</b>

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.074
<b>- If you wanna join Duke Health,</b>

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:10.369
<b>you need to know that respect for all</b>

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.455
<b>and a sense of belonging is</b>

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.207
<b>foundational to how we think</b>

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:16.042
<b>and how we act.</b>

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.419
<b>When people feel valued,</b>

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.421
<b>feel like they have a voice,</b>

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.340
<b>that's when they wake up with a smile,</b>

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.341
<b>go to bed with a smile</b>

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.175
<b>and that's what we want</b>

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:25.510
<b>and that's how we get connections</b>

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.428
<b>throughout the continuum of care</b>

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:29.847
<b>that make this place incredibly special</b>

01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:31.849
<b>and like no other in North Carolina.</b>

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:33.643
<b>- Our culture is one</b>

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.520
<b>that we want to make sure</b>

01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:36.270
<b>everyone feels</b>

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.606
<b>respected, that they belong here.</b>

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:41.943
<b>So one of our goals here is to help</b>

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.736
<b>people find joy in work.</b>

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.238
<b>Have you ever heard of such?</b>

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:48.533
<b>That's a big undertaking and part of that</b>

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:49.784
<b>is creating a culture</b>

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.327
<b>where people feel nurtured.</b>

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.121
<b>They feel valued, they feel seen.</b>

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.498
<b>When we're coming to a</b>

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.166
<b>place that makes a difference</b>

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:59.335
<b>in so many people's lives,</b>

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.003
<b>that's the culture of Duke.</b>
