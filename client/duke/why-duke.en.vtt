WEBVTT

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:06.644
(upbeat music)

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:10.106
- I would describe Duke

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.318
culture as diverse, excellent,

01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:16.404
and inclusive and supportive.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.781
Can I add more? (laughs)

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.534
- I would describe it as compassionate.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.328
- Great teamwork.

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:24.704
- I would say it's innovative.

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.080
- It's growth-centered.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:28.291
- Family-oriented and friendly.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.419
(upbeat music)

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.550
- What's made Duke great for

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.761
me is all of the experience

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.055
that I was able to get.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.599
Coming in, I was a part-time

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:47.226
clerical employee in the lab,

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:48.770
and I was able to move

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.229
around and promote within.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:53.441
So if I wanted to describe the people

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.817
here at Duke Health,

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.944
I would say caring

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.154
and they're supportive,

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.115
especially the management staff here.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:06.371
In 2012, I lost my son, and I looked up

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.415
and I noticed that my manager at the time

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.709
had closed the department

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:15.004
so that my immediate peers

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.506
could attend and

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:17.840
support me at the funeral.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.176
So at that time is when I really realized

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.137
that I was more than just someone at Duke

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:24.806
with a Duke unique ID.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:29.394
- One thing Duke has always done,

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.395
I've found is always asking,

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:31.729
what do you need to do your job?

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.481
And they expect a real answer.

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:34.232
It's just not, no,

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.608
everything's fine, great, thank you.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.485
They really wanna know how you're feeling

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.569
and know what do you need.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:39.612
- There's so many

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:40.863
things that make you proud

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.032
for working here, so many things.

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:44.242
The differences we

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.660
make each and every day

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.579
that your teams, other teams make,

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:49.914
that just makes you so

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:51.374
very proud to work here.

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:52.750
- Every day we have a

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:53.876
chance to help somebody.

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:56.671
Our patients come to us with some sort of

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.840
life threatening situation

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.591
that we're able to help them.

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:02.510
And that makes me feel good.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.849
- Being born and raised in Durham,

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.268
I had always loved Duke and always dreamt

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:11.894
of having a career at Duke.

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:13.062
When one of my patients

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.188
ended up in the hospital

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.065
and I found out there was an opening,

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.525
it just kinda seemed meant to be.

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:19.986
Duke automatically put me

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.529
in a nurse residency program,

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:22.447
which was the support

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:23.739
and mentorship program.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.533
For me, it was really

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.868
about feeling supported,

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.202
utilizing the skills that

01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:29.829
I learned in nursing school

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:30.997
and being able to

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.249
apply them in my workforce,

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.792
what I'm doing day to day.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:37.962
- I think one thing that

01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.130
kind of just continually

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.256
makes me proud to be

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.466
here is every time I've gone

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.426
to a conference and presented work

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.052
or just shared with an

01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:46.137
external organization,

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:47.221
one question they

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:49.098
always ask is with quality,

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.808
how did you get managers and directors

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:52.768
and executive leaders to support you?

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.479
And my answer has always been like,

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:56.314
I didn't have to, they already did.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.941
I work with so many innovative people.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.735
I get to hear so many

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.236
cool ideas that people have

01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:03.529
that they wanna try and implement

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:05.072
and I get to help support them do that.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.074
- If you wanna join Duke Health,

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:10.369
you need to know that respect for all

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.455
and a sense of belonging is

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.207
foundational to how we think

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:16.042
and how we act.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.419
When people feel valued,

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.421
feel like they have a voice,

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.340
that's when they wake up with a smile,

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.341
go to bed with a smile

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.175
and that's what we want

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:25.510
and that's how we get connections

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.428
throughout the continuum of care

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:29.847
that make this place incredibly special

01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:31.849
and like no other in North Carolina.

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:33.643
- Our culture is one

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.520
that we want to make sure

01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:36.270
everyone feels

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.606
respected, that they belong here.

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:41.943
So one of our goals here is to help

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.736
people find joy in work.

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.238
Have you ever heard of such?

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:48.533
That's a big undertaking and part of that

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:49.784
is creating a culture

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.327
where people feel nurtured.

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.121
They feel valued, they feel seen.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.498
When we're coming to a

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.166
place that makes a difference

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:59.335
in so many people's lives,

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.003
that's the culture of Duke.
