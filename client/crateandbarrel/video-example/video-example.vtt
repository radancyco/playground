(cheerful music)

00:00:01.392 --> 00:00:02.976
<v Woman>Every item that we sell</v>

3
00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:04.356
has to go through many stages

4
00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:05.906
in supply chain before it ever makes it

5
00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.823
to the customer's home.

6
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.817

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.900
and internationally.

9
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:17.751
With a multi-department effort

10
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.641
of approximately 8,000 Crate associates,

11
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.024
we're able to make that happen.

12
00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.002
(phone rings)

13
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:25.835

26
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.061
and 13% are over chat, so we handle all the Crate

27
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.769
and CB2 in the contact center.

28
00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.861 line:15% 
It's really important to have those associate relationships

29
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.201
so they know that that's part of the culture

30
00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.560 line:15% 
and they can reinforce that with our customers.

31
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.890 line:15% 
<v ->Well, it's a job.
(woman laughs)

32
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 line:15% 
and somebody has to do it.

<v ->What's not to like?</v>

37
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:17.438
<v ->So the thing I love about it most</v>

38
00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.832
is the associates are just one big huge team

39
00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:23.112
that want to connect with the customers and with each other

40
00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:25.083
and with all the other departments and channels

41
00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:26.414
in the company.

42
00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:29.583
It's very very important to us to

43
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:33.062 line:15% 
know that people feel that we're supporting what they do

44
00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:35.472 line:15% 
and supporting the business the best way that we can

45
00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:39.734 line:15% 
and of course providing excellent customer service.
