  I'm afraid this is incorrect. Size is not being considered as a factor here. In order to pass, the text would have to bold, yes, but the size must also increase. Currently it is 15px, so it will still fail. To pass, the size would need to be increased to 18.67px (round off to 19px). I have a test page running here. In it, you can see that blue/gray at 15px failing, while the second heading, set to 19px and bold, passes. https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://radancy.dev/playground/color-test.html
