        <h3>Sean Garrow</h3>

        <p>"During my 8 year career at OC, I have been able to grow and develop myself personally and professionally, from learning everything in plant operations to now the maintenance department. The never ending passion that the Delmar Leadership Team shows accelerates our employees success and has allowed me to overcome challenges and develop to be a stronger leader."</p>

        <h3>Sam Gloria</h3>

        <span>Batch House Leader</span>

        <p>"I have been with Owens Corning for 9 years starting in the entry level position Forming Winder Operator.  Since then I was able to move through to other positions in the plant in Fabrication, Quality and now my current position as the Batch House Leader.  In my mind, OC has been great for me, it has given me the opportunity to grow and develop in my career. They have always rewarded hard work and the willingness to learn new things. In the various positions that I have had here at the plant, I feel that it has given me the insight into our process, as well as giving me the chance to improve in my people leadership and communication. I enjoy working for OC and I will always say that the best part of working here is the opportunities that are available to employees that want to advance and grow in their careers."</p>

        <h3>Kevin O'Brien</h3>

        <span>Plant Operations Manager</span>

        <p>"I've worked for many different organizations over the years and I feel like I've finally found the right one… Owens Corning feels like home. What sets it apart for me is the culture of inclusion, the opportunities for growth and development, and the absolutely fantastic team of people I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Six years ago, I started on the plant floor as a mechanic and set my sights on growing beyond my maintenance role. Two years later I was given the opportunity to be the plant Continuous Improvement Lead. That position afforded me the freedom to be involved in just about everything that went on at the plant. As a result of that opportunity for learning and development, I was recently awarded the position of plant Operations Manager. OC recognizes and develops talent, and has enabled me to accomplish more than I ever thought possible. I firmly believe the sky’s the limit with OC."</p>

        <h3>Maria Valdez</h3>

        <span>Working Lead Fabrication</span>

        <p>"I started in January of 2000 as a Rover. After that I had positions such as Jumbo Doffs, TLZ, Trainer and now am a Working Lead. My experience has been good, I’ve had opportunities to learn new jobs and work on different shifts. I was able to have opportunities like this because I lead by example and I take pride in my job and enjoy teaching others to do the same. Everyone has the same opportunity if they work hard and take notice of available jobs."</p>
