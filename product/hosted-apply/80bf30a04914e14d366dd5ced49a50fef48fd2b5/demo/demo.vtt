Rick Menu record record up. this meeting is being recorded alert.

Select a window or an shift meaning control sign in with Ss.

Live transcription, accessibility, issue, tracker, accessibility, engineer, regency, clickable banner, link.

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:38.289
Okay, this is the model that I built based off of the initial form that I tested.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:45.497
The initial hosted a lot of form and it's just meant to represent

00:00:45.497 --> 00:01:04.437
What my expectation is, and what the expectation of

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:17.103
People using certain assistive technologies. are and will be when they're engaging with the form looking at access with no pat firefox application.

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:24.535
Minded this next grade, as you can see here, Mainland, mark back to Job posting link

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:29.845
Focus on wounds are very clear and sustainable.

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:46.829
When I land on the multi-step process.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.393
It's, also very clear as to what this landmark is, and which step that i'm on job application steps, navigation, landmark list, with 5 items, one my information toggle but not pressed

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:58.161
completed. this is a custom built multi-step.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:08.069
I did a lot of research on it to get it right.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.381
For assistive technology users. note that when I click on it my focus is brought into the section that is currently brought in region.

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:19.763
My information Heading: Level 2 Grouping Invalid Entry General Clickable.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:30.475
How Job application steps, navigation, landmark list with 5 items, 5 review toggle, but not pressed.

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:41.970
When I when I go to each of these I items here, you'll hear that these are completed steps to my experience toggle, but not press completed.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.042
That's cool one my Infant to my experience to pop up, but not one region. by information heading level 2 grouping invalid entry.

00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:52.052
General clickable. How did you, General? grouping invalid entry?

00:02:52.052 --> 00:03:04.701
How did you hear about us? come Nobox, please. select collapse required invalid entry.

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:09.467
Okay, note that the field is is properly associated with its label as somebody who might be blind. who is using this?

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:18.119
That association between the field and the label is critical.

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:25.312
Moving on. Have you previously worked for this organization? If yes, please answer the questions below.

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:33.984
If no, please continue to the next section required. Please select. If you have previously worked for this organization grouping.

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:44.386
Yes, radio, but not checked. one of 2. Nope, That this is a invalid section.

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:52.028
And you can hear the arrow message ran out when you land on this particular radio.

00:03:52.028 --> 00:04:07.296
No. What was your email address? Who was your manager? What was your location, and what was your employee in?

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:16.609
Id Country Combo box United States of America. collapse required legal name grouping in valid entry legal first name that it required invalid entry has auto complete blank. Notice how it's a legal name grouping

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:34.345
i've organized this form in a manner that is more understandable to people using assistive technology.

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:45.449
The use of sections where needed field sets. and legends are absolutely critical in conveying the overall structure of each section is somebody using This is the technology.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:05:01.159
You know when You're just using ds and fields and labels, and not grouping everything properly, It makes the form much much more difficult to understand.

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.359
Essentially how we have it. how how we have things looking here visually should be equally conveyed to people using the system. Technology legal last name that it required invalid entry has auto complete will have a preferred

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:18.018
name, checkbox, not checked, preferred first name.

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:23.207
That it required invalid entry. Has auto complete blank preferred last name that it required address. grouping, invalid entry, addressed that it required invalid entry has auto complete.

00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:41.631
Please enter a dress blank again. Note the fact that

00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:47.479
The field is invalid but it's reading the issue off to the screen reader super important city. And it required invalid entry has auto complete state post email address phone grouping country phone phone

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.904
number the next chocolate button not pressed.

00:05:48.904 --> 00:05:53.224
Okay, the next toggle button and I click on this.

00:05:53.224 --> 00:06:01.386
The expectation should be to that we go to the next screen.

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:06.478
But we also need to make sure that we're applying focus to the section coming in so that users can start from the top of the form.

00:06:06.478 --> 00:06:13.930
And it's it's easier to understand where they are.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:40.156
So So when I click on this you'll see it load and you'll see where my focus goes.

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:42.667
Region. My experience heading level, 2 grouping in valid entry work, experience, grouping, invalid entry working experience. one clickable job title or kick experience grouping work. experience, one grouping delete work, experience one button Okay, I know that may sound like a lot, But you know, understand that somebody using a screen reader is going to be processing this

00:06:42.667 --> 00:07:00.481
and listening to it much, much much quicker than you and I might and again

00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:14.574
How this, how these, how these that are forms and sections are organized with fieldsets and legends, is again critical to allowing, assistant tech users to better understand the structure of the phone field that are

00:07:14.574 --> 00:07:19.786
to be filled out here. I have focused on the on the delete work experience section and i'm just kind of click on that. and it's gonna bring up a mobile dialogue.

00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:32.194
Are you sure you want to remove work, Experience One: remove button, button.

00:07:32.194 --> 00:07:38.801
Remove. Okay, great. So when I click on that let's let's listen carefully to what the screen reader tells us out of grouping grouping invalid entry button delete work experience to work experience one

00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:46.670
has been removed. our experience one is being removed. Okay, clearly stated to the screen.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.360
Read user that the section is now going dialogue.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:57.139
Are you sure you want out of grouping button at work?

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:02.766
Experience, too, has been removed exactly the type of stuff that we want to do.

00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:10.990
Again, accessibility is about creating as equal and experience as possible.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:30.643
So little things like these go along way are in our critical to helping somebody with a disability use.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:35.454
The these types of forms moving on at button educate school degree, field from 2, certification, one grouping list with one items. delete by up certificate, dot pdf button. okay again.

00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:56.146
Messaging. Now I didn't include any kind of messaging to add sections.

00:08:56.146 --> 00:09:07.710
I. I only added a pepper down a little bit of javascript to convince as an example, how these fields and and buttons, and and sections, should behave when you are removing

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.769
them. So when I remove the file upload here again you'll note that the fact that something has happened is being conveyed to the screen.

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:17.206
Reader, I off certificate. dot Pdf.

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:23.575

00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:25.646
What Url the Link Skills grouping list with 4 items: Delete Javascript button.

00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:30.015
Same Here Javascript has been deleted website.

00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:40.449
You are you are at the social net. resume grouping, resume C.

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:47.509
Slash. The grouping brass button required invalid entry list with 2 resume c slash.

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:55.584
The grouping brows. Button required invalid entry

00:09:55.584 --> 00:10:14.370
Okay, the error message wasn't right out that might be a little error, not part which I will fix right after this.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:29.085
But you get the general idea. The field is being read as a valid the field for zoom slash, resume school work, degree, resume field of issued date.

00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:37.930
Okay, yeah, sir. So for Zoom grouping resume sees list with 2 items to leave Hugo plasternap resume dot docs

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:45.369
button Hugo Plasternap. Resume dot Docs hit delete back next toggle, but region voluntary disclosure heading level first.

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:49.524
Please select the ethnic terms and conditions back toggle but not pressed, and conditions checked.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:57.577
That tackle button, not next toggle button, not prep.

00:10:57.577 --> 00:11:02.786
Regent Self-identify heading Level 2 General Voluntary Employee Day Day Day, New York S.

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:11.345
Department of Labor's office of Federal contract compliance programs of opens a new window link.

00:11:11.345 --> 00:11:19.012
Okay, now that I change the link here. and also included.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:27.971
A little excessively hidden text to indicate that the link those open up in a new window.

00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:48.445
It's also a good form to include a visual icon to let users know that a new team will open here.

00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:57.790
When we're linking stuff it's really important to to apply such things to to textually contextually relevant you know content you can wrap a link around a

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:07.382
Url, but it's more readable and understandable when you handle it like this, Please check one of the boxes below required.

00:12:07.382 --> 00:12:17.964
No, yes, that double button not pressed next Toggle Button up Region review heading level to my information, heading Level 2 general petting Level 3.

00:12:17.964 --> 00:12:23.571
How did you hear https, https, back toggle, but not prep Submit Button application submitted for business development.

00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:29.012
Manager, Ravency document, main landmark, mainland, Mark. Thanks.

00:12:29.012 --> 00:12:45.124
You are almost done heading level one creative Home account to finish your application.

00:12:45.124 --> 00:12:51.556
Your application has been submitted. but there's one more step to complete before you please create a home account using the button below to complete the application process. A home account is required to view your submitted application and complete future tasks in the

00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:56.485
application process, create home account, opens a new window Application submitted for business development.

00:12:56.485 --> 00:13:04.174
Manager Racy, heading level one. Thanks. You are almost done.

00:13:04.174 --> 00:13:15.758
Create a home account to finish your app create home account opens Okay, you get the general idea.

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:23.272
So that's just the high level takeaways from this little demo that I built again.

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:34.662
The important things to remember. here are structure is very, very important.

00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:46.315
Conveying certain actions like adding and removing content is also very critical, and make sure we get our validation.

00:13:46.315 --> 00:14:01.862
Working properly is also going to go a long way to making this warm a lot more usable to not only people with disabilities, but to people who don't have disabilities.

00:14:01.862 --> 00:14:15.731
So with that I just wanna jump over to the form that I've been testing just kind of give you a comparison of a lot of the stuff that i'm seeing it seeing in it or not seeing so you have a

00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:33.300
better understanding of what needs to be addressed I guess we'll have to fill out the swarm to to get to each step.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.676
So just bear bear with me as I do that. but, generally speaking, business. nap, Nap, HD.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:40.175
Bookmark safe to application, hiring utility in a navigation landmark list with one items existing employees link.

00:14:40.175 --> 00:14:45.364
I can see a focus outline there. in the clarity header. That's great. But I start to lose focus Once I enter the form section and button collapsed.

00:14:45.364 --> 00:14:50.516
Mainland Mark clickable back to have control editable maintenance.

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:56.033
Tab selected one at 5. Okay, quick note on the tab ui!

00:14:56.033 --> 00:15:01.234
Here again. it's something we really shouldn't be using on this form.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:23.058
We should probably use something like the example my just gave on my demo taboo.

00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:33.197
I is really not the best use case for filling out a a not the correct interface to use to handle freeums their complex and probably overkill, and they might not be what certain types of disabled users are expecting

00:15:33.197 --> 00:15:38.207
when they're dealing with a form so it's important to keep these things simple, and it's easy to use as possible.

00:15:38.207 --> 00:15:48.929
Just because we can use it to have ui doesn't mean we should, and that's certainly the case here.

00:15:48.929 --> 00:16:05.083
So I would strongly suggest that we reach the the multi-step process here, and maybe do something a little bit more custom if we need to.

00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:19.520
For simplicity sake, i'm also concerned about the nature of the tab ui. when we scale down to mobile proportions, it still reads as a tab you will and the behaviors of the tab

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:33.565
youi on desktop are still present on mobile for example, I could still use my arrow which is not really what i'm expecting.

00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:41.012
On mobile it should be simple jumping back one tab, 2 lighting. You can see that I kept the multi-step.

00:16:41.012 --> 00:16:57.355
Very, very simple, and consistent from one viewing context to the other.

00:16:57.355 --> 00:17:22.199
So here on on desktop you know It's pretty simple, and then straightforward when you scale down to global proportions. it doesn't really change the text becomes a little bit difficult to include here, So

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:29.558
I removed it. but we have those labels here, We can even add numbers here if we want to to make an association between this section and the you know, Section here, yeah, okay So you can still have

00:17:29.558 --> 00:17:38.447
this works here. it's signed information and it is main landmark, Tab Control Editable.

00:17:38.447 --> 00:17:48.544
My information. Tab selected one of the 5 and W.

00:17:48.544 --> 00:18:08.824
When I, when I hit my my experience, have unavailable 2 at 5 voluntary disclosures, self-identify, tap on a of my editable mic review, tab editable.

00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:25.294
My information. Tab, select application for everything is moving. when I move my left and right our keys, everything moving up and down, which is really confusing mess navigation. So, filling out this form.

00:18:25.294 --> 00:18:31.547
Now, we have loads of problems. with validation on these pages and a lot of labels and not associated with their fields. structurally it's not Yeah, the the sections are not

00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:40.417
grouped properly using fieldsets and legends, or the aria equivalent.

00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:45.822
If you want to take that route. and really really requires a lot of improvement.

00:18:45.822 --> 00:18:49.747
Be better understood. So let's just walk through the form real quick. You can show what i'm talking about.

00:18:49.747 --> 00:18:57.003
Main landmark tap control. Have you previously worked for this organization?

00:18:57.003 --> 00:19:07.323
If yes, please send first to shoot. Here is that it appears to have skipped right over the

00:19:07.323 --> 00:19:18.630
The initial dropdown. I understand that this this form might be a little bit older, and that the team has been working with a new framework.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:38.128
So if those sections do accept focus, then you can disregard it and not be testing that in the coming days.

00:19:38.128 --> 00:19:52.248
So the United States of America combo box collapse required Yeah, I'm.

00:19:52.248 --> 00:19:57.435
On a i'm on a on the united States I heard the United States, but I didn't hear a label country associated with that

00:19:57.435 --> 00:20:15.013
We'll know what the checkbox is for because there's no label going to the dress line.

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:20.642
One start with 2 today, one top e and you'd be Twelve-third City-star, and it required invalid entry at the up of Kel. What end combo box collapse required list select one end New

00:20:20.642 --> 00:20:24.509
Minnesota, New York Combo application for well this looks like a custom dropdown.

00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:36.770
I I don't know why we're using it I don't know what the reasoning for it is.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:45.220
It's always better to use native where we can so if you don't require you know a custom drop down there.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:55.590
You're always gonna get more dying for your buck when you native html elements is less risk of

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:05.314
Whoever built the framework component that they goofed up accessibility it's always gonna have full screen.

00:21:05.314 --> 00:21:12.381
Keyboard support and things like that I I understand that sometimes it's necessary to to use components for certain things.

00:21:12.381 --> 00:21:14.689
But we have to really make sure that those are fully accessible mainland.

00:21:14.689 --> 00:21:19.887
Mark postal code star, and it required invalid entry.

00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:40.682
1, 5, 12 email address, email-star edit required invocate.

00:21:40.682 --> 00:21:43.611
You Good application for business. develop main landmark, tab control editable.

00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:50.069
My information property page expanded email star, and it required invalid entry.

00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:54.832
Has auto complete invalid email address, format. Please use Apc and example.

00:21:54.832 --> 00:22:00.828
Dot com selected Hugo dot plastern fitchy mail. Okay, Well, that's good.

00:22:00.828 --> 00:22:09.866
It's it's reading out the error I can only hope that all of the other fields do somewhere.

00:22:09.866 --> 00:22:19.409
We I know I did notice some some inconsistencies but that's something we definitely have to be mindful of biggest problem I have with validation.

00:22:19.409 --> 00:22:22.730
I think, is is not so much the field, although we do need to pay some attention to

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:32.633
How those are are rendered and how they sound.

00:22:32.633 --> 00:22:46.272
People using It's just a technology. but i'll give you an example when I fill .

00:22:46.272 --> 00:22:53.326
You go dot plastic

00:22:53.326 --> 00:23:07.213
Emails start editing invalid entry has auto complete the field email that's required and must have a value blank.

00:23:07.213 --> 00:23:23.134
Okay, fine. But if I missed this initially,

00:23:23.134 --> 00:23:31.400
And I phone numbers United States of America. United States phone numbers start at 4, 7, 8 in mouth, 7 phone extension application for content Info and Twitter link.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:39.924
Next. Okay, since I I forgot a field and I landed on the next button, which I can't seem to tant to with my keyboard.

00:23:39.924 --> 00:23:54.194
There's no indication that there's something wrong in the rest of the forum.

00:23:54.194 --> 00:23:59.960
So what should happen probably is, when you hit next, and if there are form validation issues, you should probably go, and I.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.752
I would probably place focus in the first element that has a problem.

00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:14.207
If you can. So that way the user can at least start from there and address that particular problem.
