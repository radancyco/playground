Hi [~anhill] See my comments below. While some of my requests may seem overzealous, such issues have either been discovered by myself or via third-party audits and are what I will be asking us to address when we do address other form shortcomings across product. Consider getting things right here to be a test run of sorts. ;-)

*All input fields*

Remove *aria-required*. The required attribute is all that is required here (pun intended). Note: It would be nice if this attribute was output as a boolean instead of required="required", too.

Include *aria-invalid="true"* on input fields that are required. The default state should be set to false and the value should be toggled between true and false upon validation.

*Validation*

The validation messages need to include a more distinct association with the field throwing the error, which will aid assistive technology users. Rather than the vague "this field is required", please change to:

*First Name is required.*

*Last Name is required.*

*Email Address is required.*



*Terms of Service*

The label element for the checkbox is missing the associated for attribute:

<div class="acceptance-requirements">

  <input type="checkbox" name="AcceptanceRequirement" id="acceptance-requirement" checked="">

  <label for="acceptance-requirement" class="consentRequirements">

    ...

  </label>

</div>

The label element for the checkbox contains an empty child label. Please remove.

<div class="acceptance-requirements">

  <input type="checkbox" name="AcceptanceRequirement" id="acceptance-requirement" checked="">

  <label for="acceptance-requirement" class="consentRequirements">

    ...

    <label></label>

  </label>

</div>

Links that open new windows should include the following:

rel="noopener"

And accessibly hidden text to indicate that link will spawn new window. For example:

<a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="...">Terms of Service <span class="visually-hidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> ...

or

<a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="..." aria-label="Terms of Service (opens in new window)">Terms of Service</a>

There is a stray end quote at end of the TOS sentence:

Submt Button

For consistency, please wrap submit button in a div element instead of a <p> element.

<div class="form-field submit">

	<button type="submit">Apply</button>

</div>

Drew, nothing appears to happen when form submitted. Will need to see that eventually.
